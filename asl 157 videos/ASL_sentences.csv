_*736 0:31 |hello again .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*737 0:32 |the topic that i would like to discuss today| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*738 0:36 |is this notion that deaf people in fact| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*739 0:37 |pose an economic burden on society .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*740 0:41 |i believe that to be a fallacy as a deaf person| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*741 0:42 |that we somehow create an environment| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*742 0:45 |where lots of money is being spent on us as a population .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*743 0:58 |if we look to the world health organization ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*744 1:01 |we know them to be leaders in gathering data| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*745 1:04 |throughout the world .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*746 1:05 |on their website i was able to find information| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*747 1:08 |that pertains particularly to how they view deaf people .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*748 1:12 |they view us as being deviant in many ways .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*749 1:15 |but interesting , i came across a quote that speaks| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*750 1:19 |to the fact that as a population ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*751 1:22 |we are in fact an economic burden on society .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*752 1:27 |and again , this is a source that 's very reputable| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*753 1:30 |and looked to from people around the world .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*754 1:33 |that particular quote led me to look at the amount| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*755 1:36 |of money that 's actually spent in creating| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*756 1:38 |this economic burden if you will .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*757 1:40 |in my research , i found four social institutions| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*758 1:42 |that lead to and support this notion| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*759 1:45 |that deaf people being economic burdens .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*760 1:48 |the first is the area of research ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*761 1:50 |second is technology ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*762 1:52 |and third , special education .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*763 1:54 |deaf education is of course a part| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*764 1:55 |of the overall special education system .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*765 1:58 |and lastly social welfare systems ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*766 2:00 |security security and vr being a couple of examples .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*767 2:03 |so i want to talk today about how money is spent| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*768 2:04 |in these four social institutions ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*769 2:07 |and then present to you a different perspective| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*770 2:10 |on our being an economic burden on society .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*771 2:13 |interesting to see , that as an individual| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*772 2:17 |about $ 300,000 is spent on a person who is deaf .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*773 2:23 |if you add that up times the number of deaf people| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*774 2:25 |in the world , we can see almost a million dollars| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*775 2:27 |that is being spent on people who are deaf .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*776 2:32 |i really have to question those numbers| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*777 2:34 |and understand exactly how this money is spent and why .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*778 2:38 |which leads me to the discussion| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*779 2:40 |of my first social institution .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*780 2:54 |research has been done in many different areas .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*781 2:59 |always with the goal of normalizing people who are deaf .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*782 3:03 |there is this notion that deaf people are somehow deviant| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*783 3:07 |from the norm , that we 're markedly different| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*784 3:09 |from that norm and it 's important| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*785 3:11 |that we be normalized so we 're like everyone else .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*786 3:16 |quote , unquote normal .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*787 3:18 |but does anyone know what normal means ?| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*788 3:19 |and is it worthwhile spending all kinds of money| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*789 3:22 |to ensure that we become normal citizens ?| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*790 3:25 |those are the kind of questions| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*791 3:26 |that i 'll be addressing in my talk today .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*792 3:37 |if we look at the amount of money that 's spent on research ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*793 3:39 |we can look at fy2013 budget numbers| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*794 3:42 |to better understand the exact amount .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*795 3:44 |the national institutes of health , nih ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*796 3:47 |focuses primarily on the research of people who are deaf| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*797 3:50 |with communication disorders being their focus .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*798 3:52 |the head of that research unit shared publicly| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*799 3:55 |their appreciation of receiving funding in fy13| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*800 4:02 |that amounted to $ 400 million .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*801 4:06 |$ 400 million that having been spent| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*802 4:07 |on fixing genetic deafness and looking at| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*803 4:10 |various auditory and neurological ways| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*804 4:12 |to restore people| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*805 4:13 |to a state of normalcy who are deaf .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*806 4:16 |so remember that number .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*807 4:17 |$ 400 million .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*808 4:19 |let 's move to the next social institution .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*809 4:34 |let me go back a moment to research .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*810 4:36 |the whole purpose of these fundings being spent| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*811 4:39 |on research is to find deaf infants identified early on| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*812 4:43 |at birth and to immediately intervene in their lives| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*813 4:45 |by spending money| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*814 4:47 |to get them to a state of being hearing or normal .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*815 4:51 |this is something that the director| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*816 4:52 |of the research center actually stated as being the goal .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*817 4:57 |so now onto the next social institution .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*818 5:00 |the second is one is technology .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*819 5:04 |we know that for cochlear implants , the cost for adults| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*820 5:07 |is $ 40,000 and $ 20,000 for children .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*821 5:11 |that does n't include all kinds of rehabilitation| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*822 5:14 |and speech training .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*823 5:16 |and it varies by individual ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*824 5:17 |and i do n't have a specific| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*825 5:18 |in terms of the number of individuals| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*826 5:19 |who have been implanted ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*827 5:20 |but we can imagine the numbers that are out there today ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*828 5:23 |multiplied by $ 20,000- $ 40,000 each .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*829 5:25 |we can get a sense of the amount of money spent| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*830 5:27 |on this technology , all again with one specific purpose .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*831 5:36 |and that purpose being doing everything possible| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*832 5:39 |to normalize individuals who are deaf| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*833 5:42 |so they can be in the line of what is normal .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*834 5:44 |within the range of normalcy .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*835 5:46 |so these funds are being spent to fix individuals ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*836 5:49 |to provide them with technologies| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*837 5:52 |to make them normal .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*838 5:52 |let 's move onto the third social institution .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*839 5:54 |that being education .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*840 6:03 |the department of education website has budget| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*841 6:05 |reported and it is public information .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*842 6:07 |and on that budget , i was able to take a look| z1NEPdLZbfs
