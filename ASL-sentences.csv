_*13 0:18 |let me tell you something you already know the world ai n't all sunshine and rainbows| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*14 0:23 |it 's a very mean and nasty place ,| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*15 0:25 |and i do n't care how tough you are , it will beat you to your knees and keep you there if you let it .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*16 0:31 |you , me or nobody is gon na hit as hard as life .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*17 0:35 |but it ai n't about how hard you hit .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*18 0:37 |it 's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*19 0:41 |how much you can take and keep moving forward .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*20 0:44 |that 's how winning is done !| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*21 0:48 |pain is temporary .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*22 0:50 |it may last a minute , or an hour , or a day , or even a year ,| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*23 0:55 |but eventually it will subside| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*24 0:58 |and something else will take its place .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*25 1:01 |if i quit , however , it lasts forever .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*26 1:10 |the margin for error is so small ...| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*27 1:13 |one-half a step too late or early , and you do n't quite make it .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*28 1:18 |one half-second too slow , too fast , you do n't quite catch it .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*29 1:22 |the inches we need are everywhere around us .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*30 1:27 |they 're in every break of the game , every minute , every second .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*31 1:36 |you got a dream , you got ta protect it .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*32 1:42 |people ca n't do something themselves they wan na tell you you ca n't do it .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*33 1:48 |if you want something , go get it . period .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*34 1:54 |do n't be afraid to fail .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*35 2:02 |you have to believe that something different can happen .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*36 2:07 |he who says he can| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*37 2:17 |you just kinda want it .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*38 2:28 |our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*39 2:31 |our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*40 2:35 |it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*41 2:40 |you have to dig deep down , dig deep down and ask yourselves ,| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*42 2:44 |who do you want to be ?| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*43 2:46 |figuring out for yourselves what makes you happy ,| mgmVOuLgFB0

_*50 3:08 |why ca n't i be the best player in the league ?| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*51 3:32 |what is it you said to the kid ?| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*52 3:34 |it ai n't about how hard you hit .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*53 3:36 |it 's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward . how much you can take and keep moving forward .| mgmVOuLgFB0

_*58 4:00 or mgmVOuLgFB0
_*59 4:01 |we can fight our way back into the light .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*60 4:06 |we can climb out of hell ...| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*61 4:10 |... one inch at a time .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*62 4:13 |to be able at any moment| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*63 4:16 |sacrifice what you are for what you will become .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*64 4:22 |most of you wo n't be successful because when you 're studying , and you get tired , you quit .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*65 4:35 |talent you have naturally .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*66 4:36 |skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beating on your craft .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*67 4:48 |do n't cry to quit , cry to keep going .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*68 4:52 |you already in pain , you already hurt . get a reward from it .| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*69 4:57 |if you know what you 're worth , go and get what you 're worth !| mgmVOuLgFB0

_*71 5:02 |and not pointing fingers saying you ai n't where you wan na be because of him or her or anybody !| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*72 5:07 |cowards do that , and that ai n't you !| mgmVOuLgFB0
_*73 5:09 |you 're better than that !| mgmVOuLgFB0

_*93 0:23 |quiet . places please .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*94 0:26 |one . two . three .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*95 0:28 |welcome , ladies and gentlemen , good morning .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*96 0:31 |today we are coming to you live from the presidential palace| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*97 0:34 |where we have the honour of being received by his excellency the president| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*98 0:38 |for his very first interview as head of state . good morning , sir .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*99 0:42 |good morning .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*100 0:43 |elected president last week with a large majority , you symbolize hope for our people .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*101 0:48 |please tell us what your priorities are .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*102 0:50 |we have a lot of work to do in many different areas .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*103 0:54 |however , as we stated during the campaign , we will pursue two priority objectives : firstly ...| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*104 1:00 |hey ! sweetheart , come quick . they 're repeating your interview .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*105 1:09 |... and secondly the aids epidemic . we will do all in our power to curb the spread of the virus| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*106 1:13 |and to improve the lives of our brothers and sisters living with hiv .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*107 1:17 |thank you , mister president .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*108 1:18 |it 's like a dream ! my husband , president of the republic ! he 's so handsome on screen !| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*109 1:27 |and he adores the first lady .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*110 1:29 |yes of course . we are going to focus primarily on certain key points .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*111 1:34 |one of these is how to deal with the rejection ,| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*112 1:36 |discrimination and stigmatization of people living with hiv .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*113 1:40 |how 's your mother ?| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*114 1:42 |not very well . she 's on a drip , and she 's resting .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*115 1:47 |i 'll see her after the round table meeting tomorrow morning .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*116 1:50 |i 'm really sorry , and that i 'm going to have to make my trip without you .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*117 1:57 |being away without you is ...| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*118 2:00 |... we must reinforce our system of hiv testing across the country .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*119 2:07 |we thank the first lady for her comments ,| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*120 2:10 |and we are all extremely grateful for her tireless commitment .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*121 2:14 |now , ladies and gentlemen , the floor is yours . yes ?| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*122 2:31 |thank you very much . first lady , fellow participants , good morning .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*123 2:40 |first of all i 'd like to thank the first lady for bringing up the question of infidelity within couples .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*124 2:48 |of course , in an ideal world , everybody would abstain before marriage ,| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*125 2:53 |and there 'd be 100 % fidelity in couples .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*126 2:57 |but , the fight against aids has to be based on facts ,| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*127 3:02 |and the actual fact is that a lot of people in couples are not faithful .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*128 3:08 |ok , what 's the answer ?| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*129 3:11 |from a very early age , african girls are taught to be faithful to their husbands .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*130 3:15 |let us create a world in which boys are raised with these same values ,| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*131 3:20 |a world which teaches a boy that a real man is faithful to his wife , whatever the temptation .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*132 3:28 |of course , such a huge change will take time , and hiv/aids is a threat to us right now .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*133 3:34 |so , we women must take matters into our own hands and protect ourselves .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*134 3:38 |sisters , we have got to act !| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*135 3:44 |we have to see to it that our husbands do not bring hiv into our homes , sisters .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*136 3:51 |we have to protect ourselves , and protect our future children .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*137 3:55 |what can be done , specifically ?| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*138 3:58 |first lady , i have a few ideas ... .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*139 4:19 |alright ?| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*140 4:21 |hmm , and you ?| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*141 4:22 |yes , i 'm fine .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*142 4:24 |tell me exactly what the doctor said about your mother ?| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*143 4:27 |as you know , my mother is a strong woman .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*144 4:30 |the doctor wants to keep her in hospital a few more days .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*145 4:34 |she 'll be fine . do n't worry .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*146 4:37 |ah , here , i 've got you a present .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*147 4:42 |wow !| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*148 4:44 |you 're not allowed to open it until you 're on the plane , you hear .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*149 4:47 |what is it ?| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*150 4:48 |not 'til you 're on board .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*151 4:55 |have you seen the article on page three ?| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*152 4:57 |no .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*153 5:30 |hey ! it 's condoms ! hoh !| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*154 5:46 |here are the documents you asked me to prepare , mister president .| 2AI7PbgnQZI

_*156 5:52 |no thanks .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*157 6:25 |my mobile .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*158 6:26 |will you be needing me any more , mister president ?| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*159 6:29 |that 's all for this evening , thank you .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*160 6:53 |hello , ah , good evening my darling .| 2AI7PbgnQZI

_*165 7:14 |yes .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*166 7:17 |i gave them to my young and extremely unmarried , press spokesman .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*167 7:24 |yes ?| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*168 7:28 |you see , as far as i 'm concerned , my first lady will always be my one and only .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*169 7:32 |you need have no worries .| 2AI7PbgnQZI
_*170 7:39 |yes !| 2AI7PbgnQZI

_*307 0:06 |jesus was kind healed the sick| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*308 0:09 |and toward god 's way jesus was good| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*309 0:14 |jesus did not see him jesus| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*310 0:17 |always did what god wanted him to do he came to show was god 's love| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*311 0:23 |and to win people back to follow god and walk in god 's ways| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*312 0:28 |but there were influential religious leaders who are very journalists have| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*313 0:33 jesus UC_NGrhKxnE
_*314 0:34 |did not want to admit that they had broken god 's law| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*315 0:38 |and was sinners like the rest of the people their hearts were hard| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*316 0:43 |and they did no one to believe that jesus was sent from god| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*317 0:47 |they told lies about jesus| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*318 0:50 |and had him arrested he was beaten| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*319 0:54 |soldiers placed a crown of thorns on his head| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*320 0:58 |and mocked him jesus could have resisted those| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*321 1:02 |and stop them but he did not resist he had come to the world to become a| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*322 1:08 sacrifice UC_NGrhKxnE
_*323 1:09 |christian his life was going to be sacrificed for the sensible| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*324 1:14 |all people jesus was taking upon himself| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*325 1:18 |the punishment that the people to sir line| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*326 1:31 |the soldiers male jesus to a wooden cross| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*327 1:35 |then they strode across our pride in the ground| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*328 1:38 |and jesus hung there until he died in those days it was the custom to kill the| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*329 1:45 |worst criminals in this crew elway| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*330 1:47 |to criminals were also put on the cross is that day| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*331 1:51 |by jesus was not a criminal he was innocent| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*332 1:55 |he had done no wrong that day he was dying for other people 's sends| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*333 2:01 |not his own he was dying for the singed the people who were alive then| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*334 2:07 |but also for the sins are people who would come later| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*335 2:11 |his death takes away the sins of all who want to turn from their sinful ways| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*336 2:17 |and accept his sacrifices their own sacrifice| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*337 2:20 |when jesus died he made the perfect| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*338 2:24 |sacrifice he paid for the sens| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*339 2:27 |all people with his sentence black god has said| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*340 2:32 |that all other sacrifice is no longer necessary because jesus made the perfect| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*341 2:38 sacrifice UC_NGrhKxnE
_*342 2:48 |the enemies of jesus told that they had destroyed him| UC_NGrhKxnE

_*348 3:17 |rolled away| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*349 3:18 |and jesus was not there they were even more surprised to see two angels| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*350 3:24 |who told them that jesus was alive do use messengers from god| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*351 3:29 |told them very clearly that jesus had risen from the dead| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*352 3:33 done UC_NGrhKxnE
_*353 3:39 by UC_NGrhKxnE
_*354 3:43 |after jesus rose from the dead| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*355 3:45 |he began to visit some of his disciples he talked with them| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*356 3:49 |n8 with them thomas one of his disciples| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*357 3:53 |heard said could not believe that jesus was alive again| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*358 3:58 |he said until i see his nail wounds in touch him| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*359 4:02 |i will not believe jesus came to this group to gain| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*360 4:07 |this time when thomas was there jesus spoke directly to thomas| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*361 4:13 |and thomas fell down on his knees before him leaving| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*362 4:16 |jesus said| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*363 4:19 |you believe because you see me| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*364 4:22 |blessed are those who do not see me| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*365 4:26 |and yet believe the in| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*366 4:36 |for forty days after jesus rose from the dead| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*367 4:39 |he appeared to people many people show him and knew that he was alive| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*368 4:45 |nile was time for jesus to go back to heaven| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*369 4:49 |he had finished the work he had come to do| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*370 4:52 |jesus told his followers that they were to go out and tell everyone everywhere| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*371 4:58 |what he had done| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*372 4:59 |then as many others follow was watched| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*373 5:02 |jesus rose off the ground and went higher| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*374 5:06 |and higher until he went into a cloud and disappeared from their site| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*375 5:11 |just then two angels appeared| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*376 5:15 |they told the disciples for jesus would one day return in the same way that he| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*377 5:20 |had left| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*378 5:21 |he is now in heaven preparing a place for all those| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*379 5:26 |who will believe in and follow him| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*380 5:29 |jesus made the way for us| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*381 5:33 |to come to god % uh| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*382 5:38 in UC_NGrhKxnE

_*385 5:51 |jesus never send he died to take away the sender 's separates us from god| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*386 5:58 |across reminds us that jesus was| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*387 6:01 |spotless lamb of god he was sacrificed for us| UC_NGrhKxnE

_*389 6:11 |god forgives our sins jesus makes us god 's children| UC_NGrhKxnE
_*390 6:17 |and his friends| UC_NGrhKxnE

_*393 6:34 |he taught that there are two roads everyone starts out on a wide road soon| UC_NGrhKxnE

_*431 1:24 those jozhKNUDY_8

_*734 4:27 |hell are you still there| d2gqqtUy3WE
_*735 4:33 |your colors left the screen| d2gqqtUy3WE
_*736 0:31 |hello again .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*737 0:32 |the topic that i would like to discuss today| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*738 0:36 |is this notion that deaf people in fact| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*739 0:37 |pose an economic burden on society .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*740 0:41 |i believe that to be a fallacy as a deaf person| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*741 0:42 |that we somehow create an environment| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*742 0:45 |where lots of money is being spent on us as a population .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*743 0:58 |if we look to the world health organization ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*744 1:01 |we know them to be leaders in gathering data| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*745 1:04 |throughout the world .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*746 1:05 |on their website i was able to find information| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*747 1:08 |that pertains particularly to how they view deaf people .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*748 1:12 |they view us as being deviant in many ways .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*749 1:15 |but interesting , i came across a quote that speaks| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*750 1:19 |to the fact that as a population ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*751 1:22 |we are in fact an economic burden on society .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*752 1:27 |and again , this is a source that 's very reputable| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*753 1:30 |and looked to from people around the world .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*754 1:33 |that particular quote led me to look at the amount| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*755 1:36 |of money that 's actually spent in creating| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*756 1:38 |this economic burden if you will .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*757 1:40 |in my research , i found four social institutions| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*758 1:42 |that lead to and support this notion| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*759 1:45 |that deaf people being economic burdens .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*760 1:48 |the first is the area of research ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*761 1:50 |second is technology ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*762 1:52 |and third , special education .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*763 1:54 |deaf education is of course a part| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*764 1:55 |of the overall special education system .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*765 1:58 |and lastly social welfare systems ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*766 2:00 |security security and vr being a couple of examples .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*767 2:03 |so i want to talk today about how money is spent| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*768 2:04 |in these four social institutions ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*769 2:07 |and then present to you a different perspective| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*770 2:10 |on our being an economic burden on society .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*771 2:13 |interesting to see , that as an individual| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*772 2:17 |about $ 300,000 is spent on a person who is deaf .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*773 2:23 |if you add that up times the number of deaf people| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*774 2:25 |in the world , we can see almost a million dollars| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*775 2:27 |that is being spent on people who are deaf .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*776 2:32 |i really have to question those numbers| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*777 2:34 |and understand exactly how this money is spent and why .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*778 2:38 |which leads me to the discussion| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*779 2:40 |of my first social institution .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*780 2:54 |research has been done in many different areas .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*781 2:59 |always with the goal of normalizing people who are deaf .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*782 3:03 |there is this notion that deaf people are somehow deviant| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*783 3:07 |from the norm , that we 're markedly different| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*784 3:09 |from that norm and it 's important| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*785 3:11 |that we be normalized so we 're like everyone else .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*786 3:16 |quote , unquote normal .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*787 3:18 |but does anyone know what normal means ?| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*788 3:19 |and is it worthwhile spending all kinds of money| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*789 3:22 |to ensure that we become normal citizens ?| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*790 3:25 |those are the kind of questions| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*791 3:26 |that i 'll be addressing in my talk today .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*792 3:37 |if we look at the amount of money that 's spent on research ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*793 3:39 |we can look at fy2013 budget numbers| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*794 3:42 |to better understand the exact amount .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*795 3:44 |the national institutes of health , nih ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*796 3:47 |focuses primarily on the research of people who are deaf| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*797 3:50 |with communication disorders being their focus .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*798 3:52 |the head of that research unit shared publicly| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*799 3:55 |their appreciation of receiving funding in fy13| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*800 4:02 |that amounted to $ 400 million .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*801 4:06 |$ 400 million that having been spent| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*802 4:07 |on fixing genetic deafness and looking at| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*803 4:10 |various auditory and neurological ways| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*804 4:12 |to restore people| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*805 4:13 |to a state of normalcy who are deaf .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*806 4:16 |so remember that number .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*807 4:17 |$ 400 million .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*808 4:19 |let 's move to the next social institution .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*809 4:34 |let me go back a moment to research .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*810 4:36 |the whole purpose of these fundings being spent| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*811 4:39 |on research is to find deaf infants identified early on| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*812 4:43 |at birth and to immediately intervene in their lives| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*813 4:45 |by spending money| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*814 4:47 |to get them to a state of being hearing or normal .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*815 4:51 |this is something that the director| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*816 4:52 |of the research center actually stated as being the goal .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*817 4:57 |so now onto the next social institution .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*818 5:00 |the second is one is technology .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*819 5:04 |we know that for cochlear implants , the cost for adults| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*820 5:07 |is $ 40,000 and $ 20,000 for children .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*821 5:11 |that does n't include all kinds of rehabilitation| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*822 5:14 |and speech training .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*823 5:16 |and it varies by individual ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*824 5:17 |and i do n't have a specific| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*825 5:18 |in terms of the number of individuals| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*826 5:19 |who have been implanted ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*827 5:20 |but we can imagine the numbers that are out there today ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*828 5:23 |multiplied by $ 20,000- $ 40,000 each .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*829 5:25 |we can get a sense of the amount of money spent| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*830 5:27 |on this technology , all again with one specific purpose .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*831 5:36 |and that purpose being doing everything possible| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*832 5:39 |to normalize individuals who are deaf| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*833 5:42 |so they can be in the line of what is normal .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*834 5:44 |within the range of normalcy .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*835 5:46 |so these funds are being spent to fix individuals ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*836 5:49 |to provide them with technologies| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*837 5:52 |to make them normal .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*838 5:52 |let 's move onto the third social institution .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*839 5:54 |that being education .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*840 6:03 |the department of education website has budget| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*841 6:05 |reported and it is public information .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*842 6:07 |and on that budget , i was able to take a look| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*843 6:10 |at how much money is actually spent on the educating| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*844 6:13 |of deaf children .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*845 6:14 |it 's $ 11.5 billion .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*846 6:16 |i want you to keep that number in mind .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*847 6:17 |now we know not all of those funds| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*848 6:19 |go specifically to deaf education .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*849 6:22 |but it gives us a good sense| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*850 6:23 |of how much money is actually spent .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*851 6:25 |$ 11.5 billion .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*852 6:27 |now there are also very specific programs| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*853 6:29 |within those budgets that are line items| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*854 6:31 |that are designated primarily for deaf people .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*855 6:34 |deaf people in special education settings ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*856 6:35 |we can look at them in a preschool environment| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*857 6:37 |and find that monies are spent in that area| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*858 6:39 |that amount to roughly $ 400 million .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*859 6:43 |so we have a total of $ 12 billion being spent| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*860 6:46 |on providing children within special ed deaf education .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*861 6:51 |literature shows that deaf education success| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*862 6:56 |in these environments is questionable .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*863 6:59 |so much money is being spent on speech training| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*864 7:00 |and technological needs in the classroom ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*865 7:06 |on auditory processing and auditory training| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*866 7:08 |that the amount of money that is being spent may not| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*867 7:09 |in fact equate to success as a result of all those efforts .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*868 7:17 |we 've looked at vocational rehabilitation ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*869 7:19 |we 've looked at some numbers on education ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*870 7:21 |and we know that vocational rehabilitation| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*871 7:23 |supports education .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*872 7:25 |in fact we have about $ 3 billion| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*873 7:28 |that have been spent in this area .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*874 7:30 |social security can be compartmentalized| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*875 7:33 |into two different pieces .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*876 7:34 |ssi , with about $ 50 million being spent| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*877 7:37 |in that arena .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*878 7:38 |and ssdi , where we have about $ 150 million| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*879 7:41 |being spent in ssdi payouts .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*880 7:54 |so with all that i 've shared today| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*881 7:56 |and each of these different arenas ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*882 7:58 |and we 're going to remove technology from them ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*883 8:01 |because again we do n't have the exact figures| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*884 8:02 |based on how much money is spent for cochlear implants .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*885 8:06 |if we look at just the three remaining sections ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*886 8:08 |we can see that $ 19 billion is spent on people who are deaf .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*887 8:16 |so if you take a step back and hear that number ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*888 8:18 |it certainly does seem| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*889 8:20 |that we are an economic burden to society .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*890 8:22 |unquestionably , that may seem to be true| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*891 8:25 |based on the numbers alone .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*892 8:26 |but we need to clarify what this money| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*893 8:29 |is going towards .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*894 8:30 |we understand that research is related to deafness ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*895 8:32 |and we understand that deaf education| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*896 8:33 |and special education arena , all of the funds| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*897 8:36 |are not specifically designated to deaf education .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*898 8:39 |we could probably say this is a rough figure in terms| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*899 8:43 |of the amount of money spent on deaf people .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*900 8:45 |and i 'm not in any way disagreeing| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*901 8:47 |that this is an exorbitant amount of money .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*902 8:50 |i wonder though about the perspective that 's been used| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*903 8:53 |to better understand how this money is spent .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*904 8:56 |i believe it comes from a medical model| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*905 8:58 |and an approach of a pathological view| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*906 9:00 |of us being abnormal .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*907 9:02 |now do we see ourselves as being disabled ?| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*908 9:05 |deviant from the norm and in some way unorthodox| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*909 9:08 |and straying from what should be normal ?| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*910 9:10 |we see ourselves as being self-sufficient and secure .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*911 9:16 |but the frame we see ourselves in| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*912 9:18 |is not from one that we need| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*913 9:20 |to become normal like everyone else .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*914 9:22 |and unfortunately all the money that has been spent| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*915 9:24 |to date has been spent on creating that about us .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*916 9:27 |creating that process where we can be normalized .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*917 9:29 |but if we shift that focus , shift that paradigm ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*918 9:32 |i believe we can propose an idea| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*919 9:35 |where less funding will be spent with greater results .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*920 9:46 |and my ideas of how we can shift those funds| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*921 9:48 |for a more optimal result is looking at those billions| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*922 9:52 |of dollars that are spent| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*923 9:54 |and being used in a different way .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*924 9:58 |not being used in a way that will help us become normal| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*925 10:01 |as that 's defined by the larger society ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*926 10:04 |instead using those funds to do research ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*927 10:06 |not on the hearing mechanisms| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*928 10:08 |on restoring the ability of people to hear ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*929 10:10 |but looking at how we as deaf people ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*930 10:11 |as visual individuals ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*931 10:13 |can contribute to the understanding| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*932 10:15 |of the visual nature of who we are| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*933 10:16 |to greater society and all humankind .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*934 10:20 |that would save money as opposed to cost money .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*935 10:23 |and help people better understand| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*936 10:25 |how much we are all alike as human beings .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*937 10:28 |now let 's look at deaf education .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*938 10:30 |literature to date has really focused| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*939 10:32 |on speech training and auditory oral training .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*940 10:35 |really focusing this idea of dependency .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*941 10:38 |that deaf people are a burden as a result| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*942 10:41 |of their inability to speak .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*943 10:42 |but what if we focused money on how deaf people can learn| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*944 10:44 |in a bilingual , bicultural environment .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*945 10:47 |and if speech is accessible , of course , add that .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*946 10:50 |but let 's approach education in a different way .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*947 10:52 |by doing so , we can see a heightened quality of life .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*948 10:58 |when infants are first diagnosed as deaf ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*949 11:01 |i think what often happens is the goal is| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*950 11:03 |to help them become hearing .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*951 11:05 |but if we approached this differently , and provided| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*952 11:07 |services and support in a clearinghouse sort of way ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*953 11:09 |that parents going through the grieving process| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*954 11:11 |with a recently-diagnosed deaf child| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*955 11:13 |would get support that they need| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*956 11:15 |in their home environment ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*957 11:16 |they would have access to cultural information .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*958 11:18 |everything would come to them in their home environment| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*959 11:20 |and they could access services| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*960 11:21 |and information and helping their child| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*961 11:24 |be more attuned and more capable| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*962 11:27 |of having success later in life ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*963 11:29 |having that early foundation well formed .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*964 11:32 |we know the quality of interpreting services| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*965 11:34 |for students who are in mainstreamed classrooms| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*966 11:36 |in insufficient .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*967 11:37 |monies could be spent to provide interpreter training programs| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*968 11:40 |with the services they need to better improve| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*969 11:42 |the quality of interpreting services| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*970 11:43 |that are given to these children in educational settings .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*971 11:46 |in the last area of technology ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*972 11:48 |we talked about cochlear implants| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*973 11:49 |and other kinds of devices .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*974 11:51 |but what if instead we looked at technology| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*975 11:53 |in a different way and we looked to find a way| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*976 11:56 |that manual tracking and visual tracking could help us| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*977 11:58 |better understand how people navigate| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*978 12:00 |the world around them .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*979 12:01 |all the money that could be spent| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*980 12:03 |on certain ways of understanding research| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*981 12:04 |could be seen much more differently| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*982 12:06 |if we took it from a visual perspective .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*983 12:12 |now all this to say , is this the best way| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*984 12:15 |to approach the situation ?| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*985 12:17 |i propose that it is .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*986 12:18 |i think we could make| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*987 12:19 |people 's quality of life much better .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*988 12:22 |that people 's well being as deaf individuals would be such| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*989 12:24 |that they would have self-confidence| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*990 12:25 |in themselves .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*991 12:26 |they would see themselves as equal citizens| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*992 12:28 |with everyone else in society .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*993 12:32 |we understand that if people are given| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*994 12:34 |their needs and their needs are met early on in life| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*995 12:37 |they are able to be successful , have successful careers ,| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*996 12:41 |pay taxes and lessen that economic burden| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*997 12:43 |that seems to be existing| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*998 12:46 |and thereby creating a win-win situation .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*999 12:48 |rather than having a pathological medical view of us| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*1000 12:53 |as being economic burdens , better to understand| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*1001 12:56 |that this perpetual understanding| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*1002 12:58 |has been promulgated by the larger population| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*1003 13:00 |and it is indeed a fallacy .| z1NEPdLZbfs
_*1004 13:04 |thank you very much .| z1NEPdLZbfs

_*1016 0:41 |she using a simple and primitive gestures| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1017 0:44 |the first time i met her she was missing the ability to tell me| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1018 0:48 |who she was she was missing the ability to tell me how old she was| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1019 0:53 |she does n't know her name in order to tell me who she was should take me home| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1020 0:56 |and show me the papers and pictures are for family| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1021 0:59 |and we had to share context she can tell me things i can show you that she can| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1022 1:04 |tell me| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1023 1:04 |what happened to her father for| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1024 1:13 |i asked her about her father dying it she said 3| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1025 1:17 |okay with three meant was| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1026 1:21 |she was shot three times to fuck i know this from working with the other| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1027 1:25 |deaf signers pictures it was shot in three places and that 's how her father| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1028 1:29 died pjtioIFuNf8
_*1029 1:30 |friend now through yes after my| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1030 1:33 and pjtioIFuNf8
_*1031 1:36 |you know but but three is just not enough| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1032 1:40 |to give me access to the information that i would have needed had i not had| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1033 1:43 |prior knowledge about that afar| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1034 1:47 |about to| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1035 1:50 to pjtioIFuNf8
_*1036 1:59 |okay which is saying is i have a daughter that one away and got married| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1037 2:02 |and that was it she never came back i had a son that went away| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1038 2:06 |and i never heard from him again you know it said i 'm alone| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1039 2:11 |that 's my life she was language ready| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1040 2:16 |i the problem was she did n't get access to language within that critical period| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1041 2:20 |and that critical window for learning language in a way that we learned it| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1042 2:25 |is closed this| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1043 2:30 |window from language remains open until we reach| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1044 2:33 |age 7 them it slowly closes| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1045 2:37 |as we advance towards puberty before nineteen eighties| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1046 2:41 |many and ethnic a rotten ones where like mary no-name| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1047 2:44 |they never encountered a window from language because they never encountered| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1048 2:49 |others with their disability but in nineteen eighty| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1049 2:53 |have to the nicaraguan revolution the new government trying to enhance steph| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1050 2:57 |people 's lives| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1051 2:59 |and brought death village children into managua| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1052 3:02 |to them there isolation here educators tried to teach them| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1053 3:07 |an existing sign language the effort failed| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1054 3:10 |the children showed little interest in learning a language| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1055 3:14 |forced upon them instead they began communicating with each other| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1056 3:18 |in there own way| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1057 3:30 |judy candle was someone from united states| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1058 3:33 |to sort out the problem i came down thinking wherever they were deaf people| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1059 3:37 |there was a sign language in that obviously there would be i 'm| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1060 3:41 |full-blown sign language in full swing here in nicaragua| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1061 3:45 |and this i said well you know i ca n't learn to better their sign language if| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1062 3:50 |that 's what you want in and work with you on learning it this another camp| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1063 3:53 |sign language and they have that mimic ask him mine gestures| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1064 3:57 |and they pointed to a group tickets and said we want to know what they 're| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1065 4:01 |talking about the turnout they were talking about a lot more| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1066 4:06 |than anyone dreamed possible cable had arrived in nicaragua shortly after| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1067 4:11 |birth a new language| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1068 4:15 |language needs company language needs a community| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1069 4:19 |language needs some sort of the trigger and i think that i think that trigger is| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1070 4:24 |it 's not so much that it needs a community| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1071 4:27 |in the sense that there have to be like two people but| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1072 4:30 |commit part of being a community is plenty to share information with each| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1073 4:34 other pjtioIFuNf8
_*1074 4:35 |might this moment resemble| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1075 4:40 |what happened around 50,000 years ago the turning point that led to the| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1076 4:46 |explosion of human creativity| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1077 4:50 |the no| pjtioIFuNf8

_*1079 4:58 |an inevitability of beans| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1080 5:01 |today we still do n't know exactly when language in part when it opened a door| pjtioIFuNf8

_*1084 5:18 |this is a her bridge implicated| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1085 5:20 |but language every language depends on strict rules| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1086 5:24 |all of them familiar thats role shipped to| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1087 5:28 |looking be in the king at the bird and ect man following up demand have dreams| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1088 5:32 |that is gon na fly like a bird are many species can communicate| pjtioIFuNf8

_*1093 5:53 |mary no-name never encountered syntax| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1094 5:56 |but it is commonplace in the children 's language| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1095 5:59 |syntex is n't the center| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1096 6:02 |rules that you learned in your third grade grammar that she had to memorize| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1097 6:06 |say spoke english the way you 're supposed to| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1098 6:08 |syntax is or language| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1099 6:11 |the constraints on language or something that all human beings| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1100 6:15 |share their the constraints that are imparted to us by the fact that we share| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1101 6:19 |a single human brain| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1102 6:20 |there the matches the constraints but the ability to hierarchically organized| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1103 6:25 information pjtioIFuNf8
_*1104 6:26 |that allows us to to construct sentences novel senses that have never been said| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1105 6:31 |before that allows us to| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1106 6:32 |put it into to tell a story that allows us to prophesy that allows us to lie| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1107 6:37 |i can share we communicate for communications sink| pjtioIFuNf8
_*1108 6:40 |when i have syntex then i ca n't really is language i 'm| pjtioIFuNf8

_*1111 0:08 |welcome too quick tips for academic service-learning| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1112 0:11 |i 'm charles cancer and our topic for this segment| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1113 0:14 |is academic service-learning research in our guests here to discuss the subject| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1114 0:19 |are paul dubin associate vice president for institutional research| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1115 0:23 |at nm you and patricia hogan a professor of management| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1116 0:28 |in health and fitness welcome to you both today| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1117 0:31 |except great to be here own to talk about research in a| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1118 0:36 |we have to recognize that we 're all academics and in order to get| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1119 0:39 |10-year din promoted we have to have some sort of a research agenda| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1120 0:44 |to build a case a a lot of times the research we would do would be in our own| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1121 0:48 discipline rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1122 0:49 |and what we 're talking about here is academic service-learning which| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1123 0:53 |appears to be outside of the discipline but there are ways to link| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1124 0:58 |your discipline and service-learning i know patty you 've had some successes| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1125 1:02 |with that and i 'm hoping that maybe old| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1126 1:04 |begin by talking about that chuck it 's interesting somebody said that| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1127 1:09 |there was a big bang then disappoints and we never got together in a cohesive| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1128 1:14 |aspect there 's a a concept i like to call| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1129 1:19 |hat-trick teaching or triple gold teaching trip goal research| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1130 1:23 |teaching of the discipline teaching through the discipline and teaching for| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1131 1:26 |the mission| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1132 1:27 |so one other things though academic learning it 's telling us that come| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1133 1:32 |our academic service-learning it 's bringing us back to| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1134 1:35 |higher system and i think that 's a good thing for the university| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1135 1:38 |what kind of projects have you recently worked on that would| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1136 1:43 |some bring these things together well| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1137 1:46 |we just started a project called real time case study with we can you too| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1138 1:51 |which involves opening up the| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1139 1:54 |on the classroom to the community| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1140 1:57 |and what we did is we use took advantage over the capabilities of web 20| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1141 2:03 |and connected with a case company in marquette| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1142 2:07 |an arch students would work with case company and the case company would work| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1143 2:12 |with our students| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1144 2:13 |to help solve problems that the case study in the case company was coming in| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1145 2:16 |real time| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1146 2:17 |and it helped develop a self-directed learning| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1147 2:20 |critical thinking skills and professional skills home animu mission| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1148 2:24 |central skills| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1149 2:25 |in the students actual paul your widely known as a| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1150 2:30 |ideas guy i was warning what you had to say on the subject| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1151 2:33 |yeah i like him i think the the field love| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1152 2:36 |you know that this particular topic is really exceptional 14| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1153 2:40 |research possibilities on academic service-learning| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1154 2:45 |can apply to virtually every discipline and it 's got the benefit| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1155 2:50 |that i 'm you can look at| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1156 2:54 |what you doing and typically we be done to do some research| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1157 2:59 |on this area arm we 've been focusing most the time however on| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1158 3:04 |inputs and process variables so how many students are working how many faculty| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1159 3:08 |you doing academic service-learning| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1160 3:10 |on how many hours a community service er done| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1161 3:14 |and really the research aspects are| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1162 3:17 |are deeper than that the research aspects are we should be focusing on the| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1163 3:21 outputs rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1164 3:22 |in other words having a lot of students work with a lot of organizations is a| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1165 3:26 |nice thing and that 's a good involvement thing| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1166 3:29 |but what really is happening to the students as they| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1167 3:32 |participate in academic service-learning what 's happening to the people that| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1168 3:36 |they 're working with what kinds have| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1169 3:38 |interpersonal and social and and psychosocial development are taking| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1170 3:43 |place that| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1171 3:44 |that the students are having an impact and how does community involvement and| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1172 3:48 |academic service-learning affected community organization| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1173 3:52 |how does it affect the people that give grants and how does that affect| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1174 3:55 |politicians in terms of supporting this so really is a lot of ground here| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1175 4:00 |because what 's been done| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1176 4:01 |is there 's been a lot accounting but its typically a| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1177 4:04 |inputs and sometimes processes like how many hours| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1178 4:07 |and really what we need to do as a as a research communities to take a look at| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1179 4:12 |what happens when a person participates what happens to an agency when you| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1180 4:17 bringin rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1181 4:18 |a lot of you know young bodies in a lot of young minds| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1182 4:21 |they can impact an organization the people within it| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1183 4:25 |to me it 's really an exciting prospect| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1184 4:28 |there 's really not a lot out there in terms of what 's being done on the output| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1185 4:32 side rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1186 4:33 |arms i think there 's some beginning efforts michigan campus compact is| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1187 4:36 funded rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1188 4:37 |an effort to try to to identify a set| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1189 4:41 |love measurable outcome measures| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1190 4:44 |and and we 've had a couple meetings at the state level to try day| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1191 4:49 |to define these indicators and get agreement that these are the ones that| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1192 4:52 |we should be measuring| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1193 4:53 |so i to me this is a great opportunity for faculty| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1194 4:57 |to get into almost the respect to the disciplinarian| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1195 5:01 |i it 's my understanding that pretty much academic service-learning can be done| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1196 5:04 |across the curriculum| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1197 5:06 |so there 's no barriers and if you 're not in the science programmers you 're not in| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1198 5:10 a rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1199 5:10 |in you know something that the has lotsa measurement so| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1200 5:14 |and i 'm sure perry could yet for settle i think a| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1201 5:18 |ultimate outcomes really to the mission of the university why we 're in business| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1202 5:21 |what are we supposed to do| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1203 5:23 |and the academic mission is right in line with academic| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1204 5:26 |service-learning before not missionaries have| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1205 5:29 |a commission or agent from the agency| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1206 5:32 |if we do n't bring that is the ultimate measure| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1207 5:36 |and in factor outcomes assessment always bring us back to the mission so how is| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1208 5:40 |each month| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1209 5:42 |contributing to the mission of the university| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1210 5:45 |well okay we 've talked about a project at your currently working on| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1211 5:48 |and i 'm assuming that you know when you 've finished collecting information| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1212 5:52 |you 're going to| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1213 5:53 |either present in somewhere a or publish it| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1214 5:57 |firm can you talk a little bit about you know how you plan to| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1215 6:01 |employ this information once your projects completed| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1216 6:05 |we 've just been accepted for emily presentation to present| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1217 6:08 |our work on this plus we 're working on a publication| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1218 6:12 |perhaps to publish in the michigan journal| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1219 6:16 |of community service learning but we 'll be publishing it somewhere| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1220 6:20 |but we also got a grant for it which is in part a scholarship from| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1221 6:24 |michigan campus compact because they were very interested in| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1222 6:28 |are using community involvement to foster| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1223 6:32 |and ammunition central competencies and students| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1224 6:35 |we 're going to develop he| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1225 6:39 |dvd the experience has parted the mission| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1226 6:42 |mission campus compact agreement for getting the grant| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1227 6:45 |and we 're going to have our intelligence dashboard| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1228 6:49 |with every um academic mission| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1229 6:53 |competencies self-directed learning critical thinking extra| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1230 6:56 |development of career skills refine your list all those| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1231 7:00 |and then we 're going to show what our students thought| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1232 7:03 |in this pilot project the develop relative| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1233 7:07 |commission central competencies call when would you suggest or some other| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1234 7:11 |potential outlets for this kind of research| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1235 7:14 |well i think get i think the the national| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1236 7:18 |arena has a series of publications and| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1237 7:21 |michigan it 's the the machine campus compact outlet| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1238 7:25 |but what i 've seen from a.m. an institutional research point of view| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1239 7:30 |is that on in many different organizations| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1240 7:33 |and disciplines the practice so soon engagement community involvement has| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1241 7:38 |become such a major factor| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1242 7:41 |the new special interest group sig nu topic areas are opening up in these| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1243 7:46 |fields and| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1244 7:47 |remember both the ku bo which is a business officers| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1245 7:50 |and m a member of institutional research says field| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1246 7:54 |and both are those have established new special interest groups dealing with| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1247 7:57 |community engagement| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1248 7:59 |and service-learning and so there 's an opportunity| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1249 8:02 |in that discipline for these kinds of activities| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1250 8:06 |and in in the air is and like nursing| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1251 8:10 |nursing journals or begin to the beginning to publish service learning| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1252 8:14 |at specially international service-learning activity so| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1253 8:18 |within the discipline new opportunities are opening up| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1254 8:21 |with service learning is the focus so i think there there are great| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1255 8:25 opportunities rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1256 8:27 |and the more people get involved in the more the population hears about this the| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1257 8:31 |more likely it is| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1258 8:32 |that they 'll be future opportunities excellent| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1259 8:36 |over of work we 're running out of time here personally| rhXphS1h-UQ
_*1260 8:40 |on but i would like to thank paul do being petty hogan| rhXphS1h-UQ

_*1409 0:07 |hi , i 'm rae , and i 'm the owner of rose sign language interpreting company here in colorado .| iIwUxON2saM
_*1410 0:13 |today , i 'm going to discuss the role of the sign language interpreter in the medical setting .| iIwUxON2saM
_*1411 0:19 |really , most of our work is very similar from setting to setting . but , for some reason in| iIwUxON2saM
_*1412 0:25 |the medical world , there 's a little confusion . first of all , a deaf or hard of hearing patient| iIwUxON2saM
_*1413 0:32 |will contact you to make an appointment , and they 'll also request an interpreter . if you 've| iIwUxON2saM
_*1414 0:37 |already seen our other video , `` do i need to hire a sign language interpreter ? '' you 're| iIwUxON2saM
_*1415 0:42 |familiar with this . if not , take a look at that video after you 're finished with this| iIwUxON2saM
_*1416 0:47 |one . so , you 've called an agency or an independent contractor to make sure that you have an interpreter| iIwUxON2saM
_*1417 0:53 |for the appointment . and , on that appointment day , that interpreter will show up a little| iIwUxON2saM
_*1418 0:59 |early just to meet with your deaf or hard of hearing patient and make sure they 're a| iIwUxON2saM
_*1419 1:03 |good language match . you need to understand that here in america , we 're not only dealing| iIwUxON2saM
_*1420 1:08 |with american sign language . there 's a huge continuum of signed communication and it could| iIwUxON2saM
_*1421 1:14 |be asl , but it could also be something like an english signing system . so , the interpreter| iIwUxON2saM
_*1422 1:20 |needs to arrive early if possible to meet with the deaf or hard of hearing consumer| iIwUxON2saM
_*1423 1:25 |and make sure that we 're a good language match , and make sure that we can adequately interpret| iIwUxON2saM
_*1424 1:29 |and clearly interpret . so , they may be chatting a little in the waiting room ... talking about| iIwUxON2saM
_*1425 1:36 |the weather , talking about things that may be happening in the deaf and hard of hearing| iIwUxON2saM
_*1426 1:40 |community ... they 're not discussing the medical issue per se . the interpreter might say , `` we 're| iIwUxON2saM
_*1427 1:45 |here to look at your knee ? '' `` we 're here because you have a cold ? '' but they wo n't be getting| iIwUxON2saM
_*1428 1:50 |down into the specifics . that 's for the doctor . next , when your patient is summoned from the| iIwUxON2saM
_*1429 1:57 |waiting room , that 's when the interpreter starts the work of interpreting ... in earnest .| iIwUxON2saM
_*1430 2:02 |um , this is also the point when it 's not helpful at all to direct questions or comments directly| iIwUxON2saM
_*1431 2:09 |to the interpreter . the interpreter 's goal at that time is to be the voice of the deaf| iIwUxON2saM
_*1432 2:15 |or hard of hearing patient , and be the hands of the hearing medical provider . sometimes| iIwUxON2saM
_*1433 2:22 |what happens is a medical provider very innocently starts asking questions like , `` so where did| iIwUxON2saM
_*1434 2:28 |you learn sign language ? '' or `` how long have you known each other ? '' meaning : the deaf patient| iIwUxON2saM
_*1435 2:33 |and the interpreter must know each other because they both know sign language . or , any other| iIwUxON2saM
_*1436 2:39 |type of comment directed at the interpreter . this is a little awkward to negotiate , because| iIwUxON2saM
_*1437 2:45 |usually we prefer that these questions are held until the end of the appointment . we 're| iIwUxON2saM
_*1438 2:50 |more than happy to answer any questions you have . while we going through the appointment ,| iIwUxON2saM
_*1439 2:56 |you 're probably going to do vitals first ; temperature , weight , primary complaint ...| iIwUxON2saM
_*1440 3:02 |the quick check in . during this time , you 're going to be in the room , so we will . once| iIwUxON2saM
_*1441 3:08 |you leave , we 'll leave . this is another point of confusion . many people misunderstand our| iIwUxON2saM
_*1442 3:16 |role as that of a companion or sometimes in the hospital we 've been called `` sitters . ''| iIwUxON2saM
_*1443 3:23 |this is not the case . we are there to ensure clear communication . we might also do some| iIwUxON2saM
_*1444 3:30 |advocacy work or some education regarding our primary function as communicators , but| iIwUxON2saM
_*1445 3:37 |we do not provide companion services , or , nor do we have any medical training so we 're| iIwUxON2saM
_*1446 3:44 |not `` sitters . '' so , when you leave , we leave . once the doctor comes back to discuss the| iIwUxON2saM
_*1447 3:50 |patient 's primary issue , we will come back in the room , start interpreting and we will| iIwUxON2saM
_*1448 3:57 |interpret everything that is said , and everything that is signed . this is another point of confusion .| iIwUxON2saM
_*1449 4:04 |often , people will say , `` do n't interpret this -- i 'm just going to ask the nurse some other questions| iIwUxON2saM
_*1450 4:11 |about another patient . '' or , `` he does n't need to know this , so do n't interpret this . '' really ,| iIwUxON2saM
_*1451 4:17 |pardon the pun but our hands are tied . we interpret everything that we hear and everything| iIwUxON2saM
_*1452 4:24 |that we see . deaf clients will sometimes say , `` turn off your voice , i 'm just telling you ,| iIwUxON2saM
_*1453 4:30 |interpreter . `` this also an awkward situation because we do have to voice these things .| iIwUxON2saM
_*1454 4:36 |it 's not fair to either party if the interpreter 's holding information for one.it , it puts us| iIwUxON2saM
_*1455 4:44 |in a very awkward situation because really , we 're there for both people ; the hearing doctor| iIwUxON2saM
_*1456 4:49 |or medical provider and the deaf or hard of hearing patient . so , as we wrap up the appointment| iIwUxON2saM
_*1457 4:57 |you might have noticed the interpreter saying , `` oh wait , hold on , i need to clarify . '' or| iIwUxON2saM
_*1458 5:03 |saying , `` wait , can you repeat that please ? ok . thank you . '' or they 'll say things like ,| iIwUxON2saM
_*1459 5:08 |`` hold on . the interpreter needs to clarify . '' these are all very responsible moves for the| iIwUxON2saM
_*1460 5:13 |interpreter to make . remember that we 're not medical experts . we may work in the medical| iIwUxON2saM
_*1461 5:19 |field , but we ca n't understand everything that is said , all the time.we may need clarification ,| iIwUxON2saM
_*1462 5:25 |we may need a spelling.um , this is not a negative mark on any interpreter 's skill . it 's actually| iIwUxON2saM
_*1463 5:33 |a very , very good sign that your interpreter is conscientious and wants to do their absolute| iIwUxON2saM
_*1464 5:38 |best . and really , we ca n't interpret what we ca n't understand . so , again , as we wrap| iIwUxON2saM
_*1465 5:44 |up our appointment your deaf or hard of hearing patient will be moving to the front desk to| iIwUxON2saM
_*1466 5:54 |set up their next appointment , or to make their copay ; whatever you do at the end of| iIwUxON2saM
_*1467 5:59 |your appointments . we may be asked to stay to set up that appointment , we may not . really ,| iIwUxON2saM
_*1468 6:05 |it 's 50:50 . some deaf or hard of hearing patients want us to stay , some office staff want us| iIwUxON2saM
_*1469 6:10 |to stay . some prefer to do away with the interpreter , because we 're just an extra person , if they| iIwUxON2saM
_*1470 6:17 |can get by using simple communication , they prefer that . it 's really up to our hearing| iIwUxON2saM
_*1471 6:25 |and deaf and hard of hearing consumers . so , i hope you feel a little bit more comfortable| iIwUxON2saM
_*1472 6:31 |about how to move ahead with your next medical appointment where you have a deaf or hard| iIwUxON2saM
_*1473 6:36 |of hearing patient and interpreter . if you have any questions , please feel free to get| iIwUxON2saM

_*1933 0:00 |chi i maria and i work by the irs| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1934 0:05 |if you gave money or property to someone| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1935 0:08 |as a gift you the giver may need to file| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1936 0:12 |a federal gift tax return| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1937 0:17 |but thats only if your gift| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1938 0:19 |was more than fourteen thousand dollars which is the| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1939 0:23 |annual exclusion a melt for 2014 and 2015| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1940 0:27 |exclusion applies to the first fourteen thousand dollars| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1941 0:31 |you give to someone but if your gift was more than fourteen thousand dollars| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1942 0:37 |you 'll probably need to file a gift| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1943 0:40 |tax return even though you might not ok and gift tax| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1944 0:44 |there are some exceptions that| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1945 0:48 |you may not need to file a gift tax return| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1946 0:51 |if the gift was given to your spouse or| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1947 0:54 |a charity or| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1948 0:57 |if you paid someone 's medical expenses or tuition| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1949 1:00 |directly to the facility or the school| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1950 1:04 |you can learn more a baptist and other details| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1951 1:08 |by reading publication 559| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1952 1:11 |survivors executives and administrators| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1953 1:20 |in the publication it has a section on gift texas| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1954 1:27 |to find it go to i are s that god| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1955 1:30 |and search for publication by 59| tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1956 1:34 good tBe02Yqy-WU
_*1957 0:01 |hi i 'm patrick and i work for the irs| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1958 0:03 |starting in 2013| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1959 0:07 |a new additional medicare tax may apply to you if you work and make more than| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1960 0:11 |certain amounts| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1961 0:12 well AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1962 0:14 |additional medicare tax will not apply to most workers| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1963 0:17 |so here 's what you need to know about the tax| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1964 0:21 |whether it applies to you and how to start planning for it| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1965 0:26 |the new additional medicare tax rate is .9 percent of wages compensation| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1966 0:32 |and self-employment income you arm but only on what you are| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1967 0:35 |above certain amounts the this is in addition to the regular medicare tax| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1968 0:43 |you already packwood| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1969 0:49 |if you 're a single taxpayer the tax applies to any amount you make over two| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1970 0:53 |hundred thousand dollars a year| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1971 0:54 |this means any amount you earn over 200,000| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1972 0:58 |you must pay .9 percent additional medicare tax| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1973 1:01 |but this amount is different if you 're married if you are married and file| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1974 1:07 |a return jointly with your spouse the tax applies to any amount the two of you| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1975 1:12 |together make| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1976 1:13 |that is more than 250,000 dollars and for a married person who files a| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1977 1:21 |separate return| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1978 1:22 |the key threshold to keep in mind is one hundred and twenty five thousand dollars| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1979 1:26 |this means any amount you earn over one hundred and twenty five thousand dollars| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1980 1:31 |you must pay .9 percent additional medicare tax| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1981 1:34 the AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1982 1:40 |if you owe the tax you report it on your return by filling out form| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1983 1:44 |8959 the| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1984 1:49 |your employer will withhold additional medicare tax from all of your yearly pay| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1985 1:54 |that is over two hundred thousand dollars| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1986 1:58 |but because everyone 's tax situation is different| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1987 2:01 |this may not be enough depending on your filing status and other income| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1988 2:04 well AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1989 2:12 |so to make sure you do n't come up short at the end of the year| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1990 2:15 |you may want to have your employer take out more tax from your pad| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1991 2:18 |i 'll or| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1992 2:22 |if you prefer you may want to cover the shortfall by making| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1993 2:25 |estimated tax payments to the irs to help you figure out whether additional| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1994 2:31 |withholding or estimated tax payments are necessary| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1995 2:34 |and if so for how much use the irs withholding calculator tool| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1996 2:39 |at irs dot gulf you can find out more about this new tax by going to irs dot| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1997 2:48 gov AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1998 2:49 |and by typing additional medicare tax in the search field| AKkxmM6DsP8
_*1999 2:53 good AKkxmM6DsP8
_*2000 0:04 |i 'm here in melbourne , australia| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2001 0:08 |and the past week has been| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2002 0:12 |focused on the research process . whew !| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2003 0:16 |it 's been intense work , but also very enjoyable . i finally| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2004 0:20 |... on this saturday ... have the chance to look around| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2005 0:24 |the city : both melbourne proper and the area| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2006 0:28 |where i am living . keep in mind ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2007 0:32 |i 'm not staying in downtown melbourne ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2008 0:36 |which i show you in pictures and video .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2009 0:40 |but , i 'm staying in a neighborhood just outside of the city , proper .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2010 0:44 |it 's called `` fitzroy north '' .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2011 0:48 |interestingly , the building used to be a warehouse .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2012 0:52 |it has since been converted , and divided into apartments .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2013 0:56 |some of the apartments are rather large ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2014 1:00 |with two or three floors .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2015 1:04 |i have two floors ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2016 1:08 |with a garage that sits a bit lower . i thought| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2017 1:12 |- after doing a little research - that this unit| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2018 1:16 |might sell for about $ 600,000 ; but ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2019 1:20 |i 've been told by some local interpreters that| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2020 1:24 |this unit might be priced at more than one million dollars .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2021 1:28 |i 'm thankful that i can rent it at a price that is cheaper| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2022 1:32 |than what i would pay for a hotel - and , i can cook for myself .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2023 1:36 |that means i do n't have to shell-out lots of cash at restaurants .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2024 1:41 |the unit includes a roll-up garage door .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2025 1:45 |and , the door is right here .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2026 1:49 |the entrance is n't in the front of the building ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2027 1:53 |that is around the corner . that entrance is for people in the more modest apartments .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2028 1:57 |the people who own the multi-floor units| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2029 2:01 |enter from here . at home ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2030 2:05 |in the us , we might call this an `` alley '' . here , it 's referred to as| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2031 2:09 |... i think ... a `` blue stone lane '' .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2032 2:13 |you can notice the blue stones in the road .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2033 2:17 |there are actual stones that are a dark blue color .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2034 2:25 |the community here is both interesting and beautiful .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2035 2:29 |seemingly , in the past , there were many small houses| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2036 2:33 |situated closely to one-another - mixed with some warehouses .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2037 2:37 |at some point in the past ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2038 2:41 |bureaucrats thought of the place as `` poor ''| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2039 2:45 |and decided to plow down the small homes .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2040 2:49 |they planned to replace them with fancy hotels and high-rises .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2041 2:49 |they planned to replace them with fancy hotels and high-rises ;| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2042 2:53 |however , this was met with resistance by the community . there is now a mix| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2043 2:57 |of both smaller , charming houses - one after the other -| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2044 3:01 |alongside new , high-rise apartments .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2045 3:05 |and , there are also apartments such as this| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2046 3:10 |one that i 'm staying in .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2047 3:10 |one that i 'm staying in .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2048 3:14 |here in melbourne ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2049 3:18 |there seems to be an acceptance of this type of colorful artwork on the walls of buildings .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2050 3:22 |at home , we 'd call this `` graffiti '' ( ack , i spelled it 'graphity '' )| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2051 3:26 |it 's really gorgeous and vibrant .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2052 3:30 |it takes on an elevated artistic quality .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2053 3:34 |sometimes , it appears on the outside walls of very tall buildings .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2054 3:38 |beautiful pictures adorn the walls from bottom to top .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2055 3:42 |the strong colors often resemble those of tattoos .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2056 3:46 |they 're just beautiful . at home in detroit , these are sometimes| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2057 3:50 |not looked on as art ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2058 3:54 |but are seen as bad . we might think of them as looking ugly or angry ;| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2059 3:58 |but here , they seem to suit| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2060 4:02 |the character of the local culture . they seem to be a celebration of| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2061 4:06 |color and diversity - and they are truly beautiful .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2062 4:18 |i 'm do n't know the opinion of people who live locally ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2063 4:22 |maybe they do n't like it , but as i walk| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2064 4:26 |around , i enjoy their beauty .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2065 4:34 |in the us ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2066 4:38 |we have roundabouts ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2067 4:42 |but they are new-ish and still a bit odd .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2068 4:46 |we sometimes install roundabouts in larger areas .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2069 4:51 |these might be near highways , and such .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2070 4:55 |but here ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2071 4:59 |in my local area , it seems that roundabouts| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2072 5:03 |can be just about anywhere - even in a smaller neighborhood .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2073 5:11 |this is a small set of four streets coming together ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2074 5:15 |with a roundabout . there are people walking about ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2075 5:19 |cars , bikes ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2076 5:23 |and all - but they all somehow work together in a way that is still safe and| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2077 5:27 |respectful of one-another .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2078 5:31 |the houses just here| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2079 5:35 |show some of the charm of the smaller neighborhood homes - one after the other .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2080 5:39 |there are n't huge front yards . instead , there are compact| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2081 5:43 |smaller areas -| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2082 5:47 |perhaps without an grass . instead , there might be brick| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2083 5:51 |and there really is n't an emphasis on a huge lawn .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2084 5:55 |similarly , back yards are n't emphasized . instead , homes are densely arranged - one next to the other .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2085 6:03 |also , you can see that there is beautiful , ornate detail| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2086 6:07 |on the front of the homes , and the styles are not at all homogeneous .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2087 6:11 |there 's great variety given to each home .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2088 6:36 |i 'm currently on a tram ( but i 'm signing it more like the auslan sign for 'train ' ) .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2089 6:40 |the trams are efficient and expedient ways to get around .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2090 6:44 |there are a variety of trams that go in various directions .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2091 6:48 |it makes it easy to get around .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2092 6:52 |i used to refer to these as `` trolleys '' - but these are very different things !| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2093 6:56 |i admit that when i first started riding the trams ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2094 7:00 |i got constantly lost . i sometimes did n't know if i was going north or south ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2095 7:04 |or this way or that . but now , i 'm becoming more| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2096 7:08 |acclimated to the trams after daily use .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2097 7:12 |really , i prefer them over driving at home .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2098 7:16 |driving puts all the burden on us to get around . with the trams , you get on| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2099 7:20 |and you can enjoy the ride - perhaps by making a video !| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2100 7:28 |here in australia , it is currently| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2101 7:32 |winter ; but , for people from michigan ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2102 7:36 |( so far ) it feels to me like our fall .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2103 7:40 |( maybe mixed with spring . ) people are able to| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2104 7:44 |be outside and walk in comfort . the temperatures average| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2105 7:48 |in the fifties , or maybe a little cooler .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2106 7:52 |later in the winter , it might get cooler .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2107 7:57 |but , currently , it 's comfy and just right for people| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2108 8:01 |from michigan . even though it is `` winter ''| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2109 8:05 |melbourne people do n't hide in their homes .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2110 8:09 |they 're milling about at places like this ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2111 8:13 |a water fountain that continues to function .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2112 8:17 |people are sitting around the fountain , enjoying the view| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2113 8:21 |and being pensive in this beautiful setting .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2114 8:29 |it 's interesting ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2115 8:33 |this bench has a plaque that says| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2116 8:37 |that this area is for| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2117 8:41 |those who have| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2118 8:45 |missing persons .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2119 8:49 |but , what does `` missing '' mean ? `` gone '' ?| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2120 8:53 |`` dead '' ? or , maybe `` distant '' ?| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2121 8:57 |being here in melbourne ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2122 9:01 |i 've enjoyed the many new friends| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2123 9:05 |who are now closer to me . i relish them , truly .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2124 9:09 |still , there are people at home in michigan| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2125 9:13 |- friends - who i feel are farther from me .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2126 9:17 |most especially is| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2127 9:21 |jim , of course . for now ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2128 9:25 |we are using facetime everyday for chats ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2129 9:30 |but it 's not the same as being side-by-side .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2130 9:34 |i 'm enjoying it here , truly .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2131 9:38 |but , during june , he 's been at a distance .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2132 9:42 |soon , in the coming couple of weeks , we will again be| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2133 9:46 |connected at the hip .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2134 9:50 |since arriving in melbourne| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2135 9:54 |i 've been showing you the things i 've been enjoying .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2136 9:58 |i 've showed you a bit about my experiences living here for the first week .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2137 10:02 |during the second week , i began my research activities in earnest .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2138 10:06 |after all , research is the reason i came here .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2139 10:10 |i ca n't share the details of my research yet -| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2140 10:18 |my purpose here is to collect information| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2141 10:22 |and then bring it back home .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2142 10:26 |there , i 'll conduct loads of analysis ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2143 10:30 |which i 'll publish in the future .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2144 10:34 |but , i will tell you that melbourne| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2145 10:38 |has many wonderful people , whom i 've had the chance to meet .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2146 10:42 |everyone uses auslan sign language .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2147 10:46 |( which is signed this way . )| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2148 10:50 |however , many deaf people in the area| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2149 10:54 |know some asl as well .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2150 10:58 |i 've noticed that| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2151 11:02 |when i first meet a deaf person , we work out a way to communicate| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2152 11:06 |and it 's possible to clearly understand eachother .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2153 11:10 |i 've really enjoyed the research so far ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2154 11:15 |and meeting deaf people , hearing people ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2155 11:19 |interpreters , and actors .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2156 11:23 |there 's just been an array of people| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2157 11:27 |who i 've enjoyed .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2158 11:31 |downtown melbourne comes alive at night .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2159 11:35 |this river is called| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2160 11:39 |the yarra river , which| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2161 11:43 |separates the central business district ( the north side )| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2162 11:51 |from what is called the `` southbank '' .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2163 11:55 |the southbank seems to be the place for creative types ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2164 11:59 |theatre , and the arts .| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2165 12:03 |at night , everything| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2166 12:07 |bustles with a variety of entertainment . i 've seen a variety of performers : puppetry ,| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2167 12:15 |and performers that even include a man| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2168 12:19 |dressed as the cookie monster| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2169 12:23 |playing bagpipes !| 91DtpW8aCKI
_*2170 12:31 |by day , melbourne is certainly interesting -| 91DtpW8aCKI

_*2288 1:26 |you decide in the first 4-minutes of meeting somebody| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2289 1:29 |if you 'll give them a fair go , a fair hearing or if you 're going to reject them .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2290 1:33 |the first thing is likely to happen is a handshake .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2291 1:36 |and i 'm going to try a couple in the front row here .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2292 1:38 |you get one of three feelings when you lock hands with people .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2293 1:41 |first thing is -- it feels pretty good .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2294 1:44 |i think you and i will get on pretty well .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2295 1:45 |i think we could do business together .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2296 1:47 |we 're going to get on well .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2297 1:49 |that was a good one . let 's try a second one .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2298 1:52 |okay .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2299 1:53 |( laughter )| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2300 1:55 |just check my cash , see if it 's all still there , yeah .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2301 1:58 |felt a bit intimidated there .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2302 1:59 |let 's try the third one .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2303 2:01 |yes , she 'll do anything i want . wo n't you ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2304 2:03 |( laughter )| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2305 2:05 |actually you all had roughly the same handshake .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2306 2:07 |but you do get one of three gut feelings . it has to do with two things .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2307 2:11 |one , the angle of the hand , second , the power of the hand .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2308 2:13 |i 'll demonstrate . this gentleman in the front row .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2309 2:16 |can you join me up here please ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2310 2:17 |yes ? the fellow looking concerned . ( applause )| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2311 2:20 |come up here .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2312 2:23 |here 's your modern western handshake . here 's how it looks .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2313 2:25 |it 's been in this position for about 2,000 years .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2314 2:28 |if you go back 4,000 years to the roman era ,| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2315 2:31 |on vases you would have seen it looking like this .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2316 2:34 |that 's the original position . it has several significances .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2317 2:37 |so the troop leaders would meet after battle or training .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2318 2:40 |they 're always men , so this has remained a male activity until recent times .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2319 2:44 |when they would meet they would do this .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2320 2:46 |if his arm was stronger it would go like this .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2321 2:48 |and you 'd then say `` he 's got the upper hand . ''| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2322 2:51 |upper hand is an ancient roman expression .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2323 2:53 |if he 's got the upper hand , his guys get the first crack| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2324 2:55 |at the wining , the dining and the dancing . my guys have to wait .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2325 2:59 |if it goes the other way my guys get first crack .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2326 3:01 |if it 's in the middle it 's 50/50 .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2327 3:03 |this was originally done squatting . now we do it standing .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2328 3:06 |so the fingers are below the wrist instead of above .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2329 3:09 |but essentially , we have the same position .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2330 3:12 |so when the hands lock if his hand is slightly on top --| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2331 3:15 |does n't have to be right on top , just a little bit .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2332 3:17 |i 'll get a feeling , at a gut level , and we think this is hard wired| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2333 3:20 |because you 've never been trained to decode this .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2334 3:23 |but i get a feeling he 's coming on a bit heavy .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2335 3:26 |it feels like , yeah , i think i get dominated here .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2336 3:29 |if it goes the other way ,| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2337 3:30 |i feel like i got this sucker all lined up , have n't i ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2338 3:34 |how do you create rapport with a handshake ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2339 3:36 |here are the two rules . first keep your hand absolutely straight .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2340 3:40 |second this takes a bit of practice , particularly if you 're female .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2341 3:44 |give the same pressure you receive .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2342 3:47 |so on a scale of 1 to 10 .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2343 3:48 |let 's say that 10 is a really strong one ,| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2344 3:51 |and a 1 is four breakfast sausages . okay ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2345 3:55 |now let 's try it again .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2346 3:56 |okay , on a scale of 1 to 10 , yours is about a 7 .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2347 3:59 |mine 's about a 7 too . therefore , it felt pretty good .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2348 4:02 |neither got the upper hand , the dominant hand .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2349 4:05 |and that 's why at a gut level we both felt pretty good .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2350 4:08 |i can see the look on your face . that felt okay .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2351 4:10 |yeah , that felt good .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2352 4:12 |yeah , that 's very good .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2353 4:14 |what happens if you meet someone who 's got --| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2354 4:17 |this time you 're going to give me a 9 and i 've only got a 7 .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2355 4:19 |so give me a 9 on intention .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2356 4:21 |now the hand will go straight on top .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2357 4:23 |i 've got to respond with an extra 20 % just to level it up .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2358 4:26 |if i do n't , he 's going to have one up on me before we start .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2359 4:29 |he 'll know it and i 'll know it , but not a word 's been said . makes sense ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2360 4:33 |give him a round of applause . thank you .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2361 4:35 |( applause )| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2362 4:39 |there are more connections between your brain and the palm of your hands| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2363 4:42 |then any other body part . did you know this ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2364 4:45 |more connections between the brain and the palm of the hands .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2365 4:47 |including men , ladies , then any other body part .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2366 4:51 |so clearly , the palms have evolved as an important part of human brains .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2367 4:55 |and they are . they make your bed . they brush your hair .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2368 4:58 |they do small artwork . they do handshakes . they play the piano .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2369 5:03 |they do more things than most other body parts .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2370 5:05 |but here 's my question to you . when you 're dealing with people| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2371 5:07 |where you want to persuade them , convince them , get them on your side ,| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2372 5:10 |you want them to say `` yes '' to whatever you 're proposing .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2373 5:13 |whether it 's that job , or a date , or just get your idea accepted .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2374 5:17 |where are your palms as you 're talking ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2375 5:19 |this is something that most people have never considered . never .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2376 5:24 |after this session you 'll consider it , you 'll think about it .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2377 5:27 |later today you 'll start to realize why people respond to you| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2378 5:31 |in the way they do that you 've never thought about .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2379 5:34 |here 's what i 'm going to do .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2380 5:35 |i 'm going to say the same thing three times .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2381 5:38 |i 'm going to change only what i do with the palms of my hands .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2382 5:41 |i 'll keep my body fairly still , so i 'm not using any other body signals .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2383 5:46 |and i 'll keep my voice as close to the same as i can .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2384 5:49 |i say as close as i can because when you change your body language ,| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2385 5:52 |it 's hard wired to your brain to change how you sound .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2386 5:55 |i 'll try to keep it as close as i can .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2387 5:57 |and i 'll use exactly the same words . same instruction 3 times .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2388 6:00 |your task is to decide .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2389 6:02 |do you accept what i 'm saying , or do you reject me ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2390 6:04 |you want to fight me or go along with it ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2391 6:06 |you want to say yes or no ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2392 6:09 |okay , clear on this ? here we go .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2393 6:11 |first instruction , do n't do this . just imagine what we 're going to do .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2394 6:14 |in a moment i 'll ask the people sitting in these seats here ,| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2395 6:17 |i 'll ask you to sit on this side of the room , please .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2396 6:20 |and i 'll invite the people here to take their seats .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2397 6:22 |those in the back come forward to the front .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2398 6:24 |and those in the front can sit anywhere you choose .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2399 6:27 |raise your hand if you feel okay about what i 'm asking .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2400 6:30 |who 's okay ? raise your hand .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2401 6:32 |just about all of you are prepared to do what i want .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2402 6:35 |you do n't even know what that is . but you 're prepared to do what i want ,| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2403 6:39 |because you feel like i wo n't threaten you , i wo n't intimidate you .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2404 6:41 |while it might look a bit silly , this could be a bit of fun .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2405 6:44 |that 's what our mind 's thinking .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2406 6:45 |i used a signal that appealed to your ancient brain .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2407 6:48 |let 's try the 2nd instruction . same words . same voice . changing only the palms .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2408 6:53 |i 'll ask the people sitting on this side| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2409 6:56 |i 'll invite you to take these seats .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2410 6:57 |the people here can sit over here .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2411 6:59 |those at the back come forward please .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2412 7:01 |and those at the front can sit anywhere they like .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2413 7:05 |give me a word that goes with this . what are you feeling , a word ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2414 7:08 |feel like you 're getting an order ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2415 7:10 |raise your hand if you got an order .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2416 7:12 |are you telling me that all i have to do is change my palms from an upward position| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2417 7:16 |where you wanted to do anything i wanted without question .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2418 7:19 |i 've turned them over and now you say to yourself ,| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2419 7:22 |hang on a minute , this guy is giving me an order .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2420 7:26 |well , maybe i do n't want to do that .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2421 7:29 |i 'm an independent .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2422 7:31 |i 'll just check it all out .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2423 7:33 |make me laugh , funny guy .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2424 7:36 |so now many of you are resisting ? let 's try the third approach .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2425 7:39 |i 'll ask the people sitting in these seats| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2426 7:42 |if you come sit on this side please .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2427 7:44 |and those people can sit here .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2428 7:46 |the back of the room , you can come forward please . sit here .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2429 7:49 |and those in the front can go anywhere you like .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2430 7:52 |give me a word that goes with this .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2431 7:54 |and not a gesture , a word .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2432 7:56 |( laughter )| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2433 7:58 |i guess that was a word .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2434 8:00 |what are you feeling with this ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2435 8:03 |this is more than an order . this is a directive .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2436 8:05 |you have not choice and you 're an idiot .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2437 8:09 |so we tested this in a very simple way .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2438 8:12 |we got an audience to sit in a room like this .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2439 8:14 |we got a speaker to present a proposal .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2440 8:17 |in 20 minutes they had to convince the audience to agree with the proposal .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2441 8:20 |the speaker was instructed to do the same thing 3 times| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2442 8:23 |with 3 audiences same demographics we just changed the audiences .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2443 8:27 |the first time the speaker spoke primarily using palm up position .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2444 8:31 |that 's how the proposal worked . here 's the bottom line .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2445 8:34 |it would work for you , sir .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2446 8:35 |it would work in australia and in america .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2447 8:37 |that 's the way they did the 1st proposal .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2448 8:40 |we moved that audience and put a 2nd audience in there .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2449 8:42 |same presentations given to the same demographics ,| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2450 8:45 |but a different audience , using palm down .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2451 8:47 |here 's how the deal works .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2452 8:49 |it would work for you and you .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2453 8:50 |it would work in the united states and in iceland .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2454 8:53 |move that audience , put in a 3rd one ,| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2455 8:55 |they get the same presentation using finger pointing .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2456 8:58 |here 's the way it works and the bottom line .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2457 9:00 |it will work for you , you and you . and america , australia and africa .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2458 9:05 |now we survey all three audiences looking for two things .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2459 9:08 |first , w/ a simple test , how much can they recall what the deal was about ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2460 9:12 |we were looking for how much were they listening to the deal| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2461 9:15 |as opposed to judging the speaker .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2462 9:18 |secondly , from a list of adjectives they were asked to pick those| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2463 9:22 |that best described how they feel about the speaker .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2464 9:24 |you reckon there was any difference ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2465 9:27 |you already know the answer , do n't you ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2466 9:29 |you know the answer already without ever seeing the results .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2467 9:31 |that the palm up speaker had up to 40 % more retention of the deal| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2468 9:35 |than the palm down speaker .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2469 9:36 |palm up speaker had the best adjectives ,| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2470 9:39 |laid-back , friendly , humorous , engaging .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2471 9:41 |palms turned over , authoritative , telling me what to do , pushy .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2472 9:44 |when the finger came out , nobody could remember much| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2473 9:46 |and they got the worse adjectives about that person .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2474 9:49 |now here 's my question for you .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2475 9:51 |what 's you prominent position ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2476 9:53 |you have a dominant position of one of these and which is yours ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2477 9:56 |people never considered .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2478 9:58 |but you 've got one that you 're using when you 're dealing with others .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2479 10:01 |now is it up , is it over , is it finger ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2480 10:04 |we know the palm down , historically , is a power signal .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2481 10:08 |there 's 4 times more power in your hands facing down then up .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2482 10:12 |i think the famous example is adolph hitler .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2483 10:15 |the nazi salute with `` heil hitler '' . it freightened everybody .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2484 10:18 |how would he have gone if he had gone heil hitler ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2485 10:20 |( laughing )| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2486 10:23 |nobody 's going to follow heil hitler .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2487 10:25 |that 's scary , that 's submission .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2488 10:29 |here 's the good news about this .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2489 10:31 |you can change and modify your hand signals with a little practice .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2490 10:35 |when you first start to do this --| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2491 10:37 |what happens if later today or tonight| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2492 10:39 |you suddenly discover you 're a finger pointer ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2493 10:41 |you 're talking with your friends and you 've forgotten this session .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2494 10:45 |they 're watching your hand and there it is| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2495 10:48 |hitting these silly idiots on the head knocking them into submission .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2496 10:51 |the thing about body language ,| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2497 10:53 |it 's an outward reflection of your emotional condition .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2498 10:55 |all body language shows is how you 're feeling .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2499 10:58 |whatever attitude or emotional you 're feeling is likely to be reflected| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2500 11:01 |in gesture , movement or posture .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2501 11:03 |now the reverse is true as well .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2502 11:04 |if you intentionally take certain positions or postures ,| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2503 11:07 |you 'll start to feel the emotions that go with it .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2504 11:10 |for example , everybody copy this .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2505 11:12 |like a form of praying , just lightly tap it back and forth .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2506 11:15 |put a little smile on your face . no teeth .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2507 11:19 |call that your attitude . how do you feel when you do this ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2508 11:23 |yeah , you 're hatching a good plan .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2509 11:24 |you 're pretty smart . you are in charge .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2510 11:26 |the word for this is confidence .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2511 11:28 |if you 're feeling confident , like i know what i 'm talking about .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2512 11:31 |i 'm in charge . i 'm an expert .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2513 11:33 |this one that may appear . you may unconsciously use it .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2514 11:35 |but if you intentionally use this| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2515 11:37 |in situations where you 're feeling tense or nervous , it does two things .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2516 11:40 |first , when you intentionally make the gesture as you just did| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2517 11:43 |you start to feel more confident , in charge .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2518 11:48 |( sighs ) i 'm in charge of my emotions .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2519 11:50 |importantly , the person who sees you do it , gets a feeling| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2520 11:54 |you seem to know what you 're about .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2521 11:56 |you know , when i first met that guy or that woman ,| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2522 11:59 |they just seem to have a confident attitude .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2523 12:01 |well no , they 're probably intentionally doing this to create that -- -| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2524 12:05 |to reassure themselves and to make you feel good .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2525 12:07 |fake it until you make it .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2526 12:10 |if you keep doing this as part of your repertoire| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2527 12:12 |eventually when you do this , you will feel confident| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2528 12:15 |about what you 're talking about , even when you do n't .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2529 12:17 |so you can go into politics .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2530 12:19 |( laughter )| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2531 12:24 |here 's my question for you .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2532 12:25 |what is your dominant position ? palm up , palm over or finger pointing ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2533 12:29 |think about life today , business and personal relationships .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2534 12:33 |it 's all first about people . does somebody buy you ?| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2535 12:36 |if somebody buys you , particularly the first 4-minutes ,| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2536 12:38 |they 're forming up to 90 % of their opinion about you .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2537 12:41 |if they buy you , there 's a good chance they 'll buy whatever goes with you .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2538 12:45 |what goes with you is what you want them to do .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2539 12:48 |the other thing is also true .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2540 12:49 |if they do n't buy you , they 're not going to buy whatever goes with you .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2541 12:53 |even if it 's a good idea .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2542 12:54 |without that connection , they feel that you do n't like them ,| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2543 12:57 |or you 're threatening or intimidating .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2544 12:59 |suddenly , they just do n't want to say yes to whatever you 're suggesting ,| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2545 13:03 |even if this is a good idea .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2546 13:05 |so you can practice palms up where you want to get cooperation .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2547 13:08 |sometimes you might want a bit of authority .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2548 13:11 |you 'll turn the palms over .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2549 13:13 |if the fire alarm went off in this building , i would say ,| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2550 13:15 |`` now here 's what we 're going to do . we 're going to go by that exit --| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2551 13:19 |i would n't say , `` here 's what we need to do . we 're -- - ''| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2552 13:22 |because it would be every man for himself if i did this .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2553 13:26 |so , by intentionally practicing positions -- suddenly , with the palm up ,| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2554 13:30 |you 'll find that people start feeling like they 're drawn to you .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2555 13:33 |in fact as we 've been talking| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2556 13:35 |i 've been doing the obama hug .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2557 13:39 |we want to help the americans .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2558 13:41 |we want you to come here .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2559 13:43 |yeah , we love you . like your mom or dad cuddling you .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2560 13:46 |like his predecessor who said| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2561 13:48 |we want to help everybody . we want to help .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2562 13:50 |you , you and you !| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2563 13:56 |body language is an outward reflection of emotions .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2564 13:59 |if you intentionally take certain positions and practice them ,| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2565 14:02 |it suddenly changes how people perceive you| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2566 14:06 |and it changes your own physiology .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2567 14:08 |you start to feel different about yourself . that 's the great thing .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2568 14:11 |you can do things on purpose| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2569 14:12 |which gives you a better chance of getting a `` yes '' to the job ,| ZZZ7k8cMA-4
_*2570 14:15 |to the proposal , to the idea , to the date . or better .| ZZZ7k8cMA-4

_*2603 0:03 |to be showing you the asl| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2604 0:07 |alphabet which stands for american sign language the reason why it 's really| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2605 0:10 |important to know| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2606 0:12 |your alphabet when you first start of learning american sign language| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2607 0:16 |is because a lot of the words that you learn are based| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2608 0:20 |off of the alphabet for example the sign for silver| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2609 0:23 |you point to your ear , you take your s hand and you go down| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2610 0:26 |you kinda shake it down . so you point to your ear kinda like your pointing to an earing| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2611 0:30 |the you take your s hand and you shake it down| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2612 0:33 |likewise the sign for gold| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2613 0:37 |is pretty much the same thing except for you take your g hand and shakedown| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2614 0:41 |so your pointing again like you are pointing to an earing then you take your g hand| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2615 0:45 |and shake it down . see simple and if you| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2616 0:48 |memorized your alpahbet it is really easy to remember| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2617 0:52 |some of the letters as well so let'st started| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2618 0:56 |a , b| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2619 1:01 |c , like this , c| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2620 1:04 |d , e , f| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2621 1:11 |g ,| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2622 1:15 |then g , you have your thumb| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2623 1:18 |like this kind of a little bit separate g , h| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2624 1:23 |you put your two fingers out and you do n't have your thumb on there anymore| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2625 1:27 |h , i j ,| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2626 1:31 |k so this way you have your| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2627 1:36 |thumb in between your pointer and middle finger k| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2628 1:39 |l , m this one is| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2629 1:43 |ia little hard for a lot of people i know for me it 's getting easier as i do it| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2630 1:48 |but you put your thumb under your three fingers like this| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2631 1:51 |m , n| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2632 1:55 o 75Sni5N-q10
_*2633 1:59 |p is the same as k except for its pointing down| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2634 2:02 |p , q| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2635 2:05 |is the same as g except for it is pointing down| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2636 2:08 |r , s| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2637 2:12 |t and the rest is pretty easy and selfish statutory| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2638 2:18 |u , v , w ,| 75Sni5N-q10
_*2639 2:23 |x , y| 75Sni5N-q10

_*2938 0:06 on ZDrNZuZ-Dr0
_*2939 0:28 |while there are a host of cultures| ZDrNZuZ-Dr0
_*2940 0:31 |today we 're going to focus on two the culture belonging to hearing people| ZDrNZuZ-Dr0
_*2941 0:36 |and that belonging to deaf people now| ZDrNZuZ-Dr0
_*2942 0:39 |deaf and hearing people have distinct cultures with their own ways| ZDrNZuZ-Dr0
_*2943 0:44 |and each might view| ZDrNZuZ-Dr0
_*2944 0:47 |the other to be strange however what 's important here| ZDrNZuZ-Dr0
_*2945 0:51 |is that we examine each other from the point of understanding| ZDrNZuZ-Dr0
_*2946 0:55 |and acceptance and respect deaf people use body language and facial expression| ZDrNZuZ-Dr0
_*2947 1:03 |a great deal| ZDrNZuZ-Dr0
_*2948 1:04 |hearing people do n't tend not to use facial expression| ZDrNZuZ-Dr0
_*2949 1:10 |might use some degree a body language but for deaf people| ZDrNZuZ-Dr0
_*2950 1:15 |they are informational a dependent on facial expression| ZDrNZuZ-Dr0
_*2951 1:19 |and facial grammar well hearing people are not deaf people utilize facial| ZDrNZuZ-Dr0
_*2952 1:26 grammar ZDrNZuZ-Dr0
_*2953 1:26 |which might look something like this : what 's your name| ZDrNZuZ-Dr0
_*2954 1:30 |where do you live do you enjoy your work| ZDrNZuZ-Dr0
_*2955 1:35 |did you see the woman did you notice my brows| ZDrNZuZ-Dr0
_*2956 1:41 |in that example hearing people would use a vocal modulation| ZDrNZuZ-Dr0
_*2957 1:49 done ZDrNZuZ-Dr0

_*2967 0:30 |students is not done in the classroom| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2968 0:32 |but it is going on at home and the reason is there a whole| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2969 0:36 |is that the learning and critical thinking portions of| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2970 0:40 |learning are you really going on inside the classroom where| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2971 0:44 |students can show me that they have mastered some subject| CUw1Hrw64Rw

_*2977 1:08 |may learn something wrong certain instead we 're gon na we 're coming around| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2978 1:12 |where this team should be doing the majority of your word inside the country| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2979 1:17 |and outside the question 's going to be gon na be just for| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2980 1:21 |the lecture type material presentation on the ideas| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2981 1:24 |and really short videos are not gon na be 10 2013 installed| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2982 1:30 |gon na be that way you know somewhere between five to 10 minutes| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2983 1:33 |want is we 're going to do this model this year| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2984 1:39 |is it that way and i think it is important that students be able to stop| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2985 1:44 |think about what 's been presented to them if they do n't understand| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2986 1:49 |backup we much before they continue| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2987 1:52 |and that way i think and they can do something for understanding about the| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2988 1:57 |reasons why we 're doing the things that| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2989 1:59 |doing in iraq lecturers so many other things we 're gon na happen here i think| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2990 2:04 |she 's gon na happen naturally| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2991 2:06 |is a woman at mikes emerge for some richard is gon na be| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2992 2:10 |faster than others some groups may be slower than others and that 's okay| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2993 2:15 |the international pressure anyway and| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2994 2:18 |there something called differentiation that can happen in a clash in| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2995 2:22 |where and i can take those groups that are faster for those| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2996 2:25 |groups that are shallower and meet more individual attention| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2997 2:29 |and i can spend now much more time in the classroom| CUw1Hrw64Rw
_*2998 2:33 |but the students for handyman spinning around that question time| CUw1Hrw64Rw

_*3065 0:40 |he 's trouble i know in my class| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3066 0:44 |i need to keep an eye on him there 's been a lot of talk in the news lately| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3067 0:49 about -A6-qrkdxts
_*3068 0:49 |toy recalls and lead paint sousa must have heard some other news warnings| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3069 0:56 |and now| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3070 1:01 |with the pencil around she must have freaked out| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3071 1:05 |right so i explain to the class| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3072 1:10 |lead in pencils is not the same thing as lead in paint| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3073 1:15 |and we 'll talk about it more detail to clear up the confusion| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3074 1:19 |since lead poisoning is a serious topic so at this point| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3075 1:23 |it 's a priority to talk about in class good idea| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3076 1:27 |you remember when i bought my house it needed painting| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3077 1:31 |so i hired a painter and he told me that there was a lead paint problem| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3078 1:35 |and they could n't just painted but instead it first acquired that the old| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3079 1:40 |paint be specially removed| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3080 1:41 |whether it 's indoors or outdoors all paint chips fall off| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3081 1:45 |and babies or toddlers who tend to put things in their mouths| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3082 1:49 |could eat those chips or test would lead in it if that happens the child to get| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3083 1:53 sick -A6-qrkdxts
_*3084 1:54 |so that serious| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3085 1:58 |it turns out that it 's a problem millions of households all across the us| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3086 2:02 |so the guy put on protective clothing and a mask| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3087 2:06 |inc carefully remove the lead paint from the house| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3088 2:09 |and clean the whole work area around my house| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3089 2:13 well -A6-qrkdxts
_*3090 2:16 |that was the cause have all those| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3091 2:20 |toyota recalls ray the worry was that| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3092 2:26 |while playing with his toys that have led pain on them| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3093 2:30 |kids might be putting them in their mouse yeah but it 's not just| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3094 2:36 |you only tollways are things that are painted| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3095 2:40 |there 's other items to i know that there are some jury that 's made of lead| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3096 2:45 |and also are male plastic items| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3097 2:49 |that have led not only that lunch boxes| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3098 2:53 |contain lead mmm| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3099 2:56 |are you to discussing lead yep no| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3100 3:00 |when i was pregnant right before my son was born we had the water in our home| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3101 3:06 |tested to make sure it was safe from lead| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3102 3:08 |turned out that our water had led| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3103 3:11 |i was shocked it seems that the solder on the joints that| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3104 3:15 |held our pipes together contained lead the lead then got into our water| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3105 3:20 |our drinking water while it 's really dangerous| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3106 3:24 |so we had replace many of our water pipes| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3107 3:27 |her imagine that while| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3108 3:35 |the inspector also explain lots of other places where lead might be found| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3109 3:39 |he talked about homemade medicines| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3110 3:43 |cosmetics and hobby material such as| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3111 3:48 |stained glass windows which can also contain lead| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3112 3:53 |what else the talk about| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3113 3:59 |whole all car batteries and| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3114 4:02 |when renovating old houses you can find lead in the paint| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3115 4:06 |and in the pipes there are many different things that have led it was| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3116 4:10 |really interesting| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3117 4:11 |i decided to do some internet research is really fascinating stuff on the web| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3118 4:15 |for instance some cultures in other countries| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3119 4:19 |people make their own medicines cosmetics and things| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3120 4:22 |and those can have dangerous levels of lead in them too| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3121 4:26 |while it seems there are many ways to be exposed to lead| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3122 4:31 |but the most common is through| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3123 4:34 |lead paint cell| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3124 4:40 |amended getting back to your situation before they 're placed your pipes and the| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3125 4:44 |joints to get rid lead| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3126 4:46 |how come you and your husband did n't get sick well the lead level in the water at| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3127 4:50 |my home was n't dangerous to adults| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3128 4:52 |however if children were to drink it especially children under the age of six| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3129 4:57 years -A6-qrkdxts
_*3130 4:57 |it would have been very dangerous any amount of lead can be dangerous for| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3131 5:01 children -A6-qrkdxts
_*3132 5:01 |for example even if it was just a small amount of lead| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3133 5:05 |it could lead to learning disabilities or other types of problems| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3134 5:08 |if a child ingested high levels of lead it could cause| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3135 5:12 |seizures coma or even death so| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3136 5:18 |when this came up in health class there were a lot of concerns| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3137 5:23 |but it turns out there were several misunderstandings we have clear them up| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3138 5:27 |i use the cdc website you know the centers for disease control| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3139 5:31 |there 's a lot of information on their about| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3140 5:35 |many different public health topics need| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3141 5:41 |so does lead poisoning affect the brain| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3142 5:44 |well according to the cdc website| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3143 5:49 |various organs in your body such as your heart| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3144 5:52 |liver kidneys can be affected| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3145 5:55 |but you would n't necessarily notice it someone could have been repeatedly| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3146 6:00 |exposed to lead| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3147 6:02 |in wooden even know it the cdc recommends| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3148 6:05 |that those who suspect they may have lead poisoning| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3149 6:08 |or any reason to be suspicious if possible exposure| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3150 6:12 |should request a blood test if there 's risk for lead poisoning| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3151 6:17 |children should be tested at the age of one year| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3152 6:20 |two years and again between three to six years| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3153 6:25 |just to be certain that there 's been no exposure i thought that a child was at| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3154 6:33 |risk it any age| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3155 6:34 |so then will who is at risk| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3156 6:38 |right but especially| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3157 6:41 |in areas where there are a lot of all houses| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3158 6:44 |that might have all lead paint on the inside| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3159 6:48 |or the outside nowadays house paint in the united states| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3160 6:52 |is not allowed to have let in it in| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3161 6:55 |mmm unfortunately| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3162 7:01 |it 's the case that african-american children are two times more likely to be| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3163 7:05 |at risk for lead poisoning| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3164 7:07 |than caucasian children are that 's awful yeah unfortunate| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3165 7:11 |while so if the kid does have high levels of lead in their blood| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3166 7:17 |what can be done to cure it well in that case| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3167 7:20 |they should be seen by a doctor or professional they will be able to test| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3168 7:26 |the blood levels| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3169 7:27 |and then decide what needs to be done in the event that high levels of lead| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3170 7:32 |are found they will need treatment| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3171 7:35 |or a change in eating habits but still they need to figure out where the lead| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3172 7:39 |exposure is coming from| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3173 7:41 |as something has to be done to stop it this all needs to be done because her| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3174 7:44 |children her precious| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3175 7:47 |right so what adults should do if they have a home that was built before 1978| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3176 7:53 |and they have their own children or children who visit| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3177 7:56 |is they should call the health department and discuss having their home| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3178 8:00 |tested for lead in the water| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3179 8:02 |or in the paint were pipes et cetera| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3180 8:06 |you so in planning| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3181 8:09 |the topic that lead poisoning with your have class tomorrow what are you going| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3182 8:13 |to tell them| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3183 8:15 |well the same kinda things we 've been talking about| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3184 8:18 |and alan curse them to inform their parents about the cdc website| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3185 8:23 |and urge them to look up information about lead poisoning| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3186 8:27 |i learned a lot of new information from there as well| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3187 8:30 |such as you should n't use hot water from the tap| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3188 8:34 |to make baby formula| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3189 8:37 |instead you should use cold water| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3190 8:40 |because hot water contains higher lead levels and cold water| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3191 8:46 |has just one new thing that i learned| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3192 8:53 |so if you live in an althaus i want you to be aware that many old houses were| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3193 8:58 |painted with lead-based paint| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3194 9:01 |to protect yourself and prevent exposure to lead| -A6-qrkdxts
_*3195 9:04 |and lead poisoning here 's what you should do| -A6-qrkdxts

_*3675 8:30 |see and hear a remarkable display| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3676 8:39 |not only does the snake rear up to intimidate but it broadens the width of| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3677 8:43 |its body is the head forming what 's known as the hood| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3678 8:51 |the monkey is being worn off and weapons are to the front height is impressive| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3679 8:58 |this is not an animal to meddle with| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3680 9:08 |to form the hood a cobra contract the muscles of its neck ribs pulling these| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3681 9:16 |unusually long bones outwards stretching the skin like an umbrella| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3682 9:30 |other cobras have a further you to talent and ability to squeeze their| V7RJgh1cOp0

_*3690 10:15 |the sacredness of animals fit in well with ancient religion cobra was already| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3691 10:20 here V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3692 10:24 |this meant that cobras despite their venomous character continued to be| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3693 10:28 |worshipped and respected| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3694 10:31 |the king of snakes has always been considered immoral largely due to its| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3695 10:36 |natural habit of shedding its skin as it grows| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3696 10:46 |the ability to be reborn as a characteristic normally associated only| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3697 10:50 |with god 's cobras such a parent rebirth is routine| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3698 10:56 |dead outer layer of skin is left off every four to five weeks leaving a| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3699 11:01 |ghostly remnant pattern with the scales that formed| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3700 11:09 |shiny and seemingly new cobra will not shed again until its body clock or other| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3701 11:15 |chemical or physical stimulate the process to start once more| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3702 11:34 |the eyes of ancient| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3703 11:37 |snakes transformation must have seemed| V7RJgh1cOp0

_*3771 21:52 |king 's to take rats instead most of these texts have been raised up your| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3772 22:00 |most dangerous consequences of that is the fact that they 're accustomed to| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3773 22:06 |being fed we open cage they 're feeling responses can be very fast and something| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3774 22:13 |you would have to be on your word for with this rat alive the cobras venom| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3775 22:19 |from two large glands either side its head would now be spreading throughout| V7RJgh1cOp0

_*3781 22:52 |came straight on and very significant by this particular sectors our best bet and| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3782 23:00 |producer to say it could reduce really been addressed with three and half weeks| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3783 23:04 |it was a fitting response by he put all that together and you know you know that| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3784 23:07 |it 's a real bad by i mean this guy was capable of over two grams of marijuana| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3785 23:12 |today and it was really good day was in june it was warm as production level as| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3786 23:17 |good as physiology with you know and you know it was a bad by they will buy and| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3787 23:27 |then they will walk one thing at a time| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3788 23:32 |time making them by injecting so that happened happened real fast| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3789 23:41 |took me i 'm sure was just a few seconds but it felt longer here to get the sack| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3790 23:46 |off my arm but i think she was the only means anything i just heard her say oh| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3791 23:52 |no she says i do n't know believe me it means up george news had to get to| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3792 24:03 |hospital right away| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3793 24:05 |two drops of king cobra venom is enough to kill an adult and george believes he| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3794 24:10 |received twenty times as much a desperately-needed antivenin an| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3795 24:15 |emergency plans were being made nationwide for extra supplies to be| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3796 24:18 |flown to the hospital is being taken| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3797 24:24 casualties V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3798 24:26 |he was n't sure whether he would live or die i do remember when i was being| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3799 24:32 off-loaded V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3800 24:33 |saying something to one attendant about getting giving a respirator| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3801 24:42 |the king cobra venom is rapidly spreading through his body gradually| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3802 24:45 |suppressing his neuromuscular system on reaching the nerves controlling| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3803 24:49 |breathing he will be in danger of dying to suffocation fortunately a respirator| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3804 24:55 |is available to take over breathing is now paralyzed lines| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3805 25:02 |gradually georgia covered and naturally he went straight back to work so many| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3806 25:15 |stories are the best king cobra go down| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3807 25:23 |in many other countries such good animals are kept for the event which is| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3808 25:27 |used to prepare the antivenin that will save the lives of people like george| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3809 25:31 |these are spitting cobras and they need very careful handling| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3810 25:38 |even here in thailand 's red cross scientific institute accidents can| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3811 25:43 |happen these snakes have been taken from the wild and the plan is to breed future| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3812 25:50 |stock from them| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3813 25:52 |antivenin czar urgently needed but wild populations of snakes do need protection| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3814 25:56 |from exploitation| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3815 26:06 |remember this cobra can spit and it usually goes for the eyes| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3816 26:15 |a cobra is milled about once a month sometimes the venom glands are massaged| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3817 26:20 |to encourage good yield when a snake bites her real it does n't always release| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3818 26:24 |all advantage here the collectors need as much as they can persuade the cobra| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3819 26:30 |healed it will probably be only a milliliters less than half a symbol of| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3820 26:39 |snakes and they have sufficient raw material to set about producing| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3821 26:43 |antivenin concentration was not lapse even the decapitated heads of dead| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3822 26:50 |snakes have been known to bite and kill| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3823 27:00 |this institute keeps its own horses and whose blood antibodies to the cobra| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3824 27:06 |venom reduced greatly diluted doses of venom are periodically injected and it| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3825 27:14 |will take four weeks or so for the antibodies to be produced quite| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3826 27:18 |naturally once a month the horses egypt ender series of four donor sessions| V7RJgh1cOp0
_*3827 27:24 |where blood is drawn from them in large volumes while the horses have the| V7RJgh1cOp0

_*3889 39:13 |countries the exploitation continues cobra is still on the menu| V7RJgh1cOp0

_*5348 0:00 |hi , everyone . what 's up ?| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5349 0:07 |now i 'm going to be talking about why gossip can be a good thing .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5350 0:19 |now , when we talk about gossip , what do we mean ?| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5351 0:25 |gossip is basically anything that people say about a group of people or a specific person| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5352 0:35 |that is meant to be secret , hidden away from them .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5353 0:47 |the information being shared may be harmful to that particular person .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5354 0:50 |or the people talking about that person might be backstabbing or shaming them .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5355 1:02 |now you 're probably wondering why shaming people may be good ?| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5356 1:08 |i will explain in this video .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5357 1:09 |ok , first off , i realize that there is a kind of gossip that can lead people to hurt themselves| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5358 1:29 |or maybe even kill themselves .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5359 1:35 |that 's not the kind of gossip i 'll be talking about in this video .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5360 1:41 |i 'm talking about the harmless kind of gossip like `` oh , wow , he 's dating someone new already ? ? ? ''| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5361 2:01 |well , *relatively* harmless ; p| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5362 2:06 |so , why is that kind of gossip good ? ? ?| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5363 2:14 |who benefits from it ?| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5364 2:16 |ok , well , obviously , the person being gossiped about does not benefit at all ...| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5365 2:25 |the person of interest does not know about the gossip .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5366 2:32 |i know people probably gossip about me . whatever . fine . i do n't care .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5367 2:39 |i do n't gain anything from it , but other people gossiping about me do .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5368 2:48 |everyone gossips about everyone . unless you 're a hermit .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5369 3:00 |everyone gossips . everyone is the topic of gossip .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5370 3:07 |alright , so who benefits ? the people gossiping .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5371 3:14 |what are the benefits ?| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5372 3:16 |ok , well , first off the people gossiping to each other are not normally complete strangers .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5373 3:29 |agree ?| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5374 3:32 |they 're normally close friends engaged in a lengthy conversation| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5375 3:38 |talking about other people , maybe judging them too .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5376 3:43 |my friend posted something on facebook a couple of days that really hit me .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5377 3:57 |and i agree with it !| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5378 3:59 |the post said : `` best friends do n't talk about or judge each other behind each other 's backs ,| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5379 4:17 |best friends judge other people together . ''| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5380 4:26 |i think this is true .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5381 4:28 |normally , i 'm the last to know things .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5382 4:33 |unless something happens to someone really close to me .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5383 4:44 |if people let me be the first to know what happened to them , it means they trust me .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5384 4:56 |that i 'm a person they can trust .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5385 5:00 |the relationship encourages support .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5386 5:04 |that 's when i feel satisfied .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5387 5:10 |so , in short , the people who gossip together are already in a close bond| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5388 5:24 |and agreeing on judgement encourages a strong , supported relationship .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5389 5:30 |ok , so the other reason why gossiping , judging , and shaming may be beneficial ...| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5390 5:44 |ok , i need to make up an example here ... i have n't thought much about this beforehand !| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5391 5:54 |i 'm making it up on the spot !| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5392 5:55 |so , please be patient ! ! ! !| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5393 5:58 |ok , soo ... .oh , actually i can use the example from earlier !| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5394 6:06 |i said the harmless kind of gossip includes `` oh , wow , he 's dating someone new already ? ? ? ''| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5395 6:22 |i 'm using that situation , ok ?| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5396 6:27 |so , suppose two people have been dating for a long time , then broke up| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5397 6:36 |one person has n't really started dating other people immediately| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5398 6:48 |but the other has .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5399 6:53 |or they showed up at a party with the new person| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5400 6:58 |and when other people at the party see him/her with the new person , they 're shocked .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5401 7:09 |and if you 're taking about the person who is dating someone new after only a few weeks| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5402 7:20 |then it might give rise to a `` if i were them '' type of discussion .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5403 7:33 |which encourages discussion about ethics and morals while people are judging the person of interest .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5404 7:45 |right ? ; p| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5405 7:49 |then , other people could jump in and agree/disagree with their justifications .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5406 8:04 |i actually like in-depth discussions about ethics| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5407 8:14 |because they 're more interesting than talking about an event that just happened .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5408 8:22 |people usually just say `` oh , you heard about what happened ? '' and they just get a simple yes or no .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5409 8:30 |there 's no `` if i was them '' discussion going on .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5410 8:35 |so , yeah , ethical discussions are my favorite .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5411 8:40 |i like talking about why i or other people would act a certain way .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5412 8:57 |ok , so to sum up my two reasons why gossip is good :| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5413 9:06 |# 1 : discussion and judging other people strengthens a relationship .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5414 9:18 |# 2 : encouraging an ethical discussion and putting yourself in others ' shoes .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5415 9:26 |so , if you wan na talk about this vlog , or gossip about me ; )| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5416 9:33 |whatever . go ahead . create new discussion .| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5417 9:42 |thanks for watching !| s6UvhpTVbn0
_*5418 0:00 |i 've learned something significant in my studies that i 'd like to explain to my audience of asl teachers ,| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5419 0:06 |in order to help with recognizing and making sense of this important information .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5420 0:09 |those who are learning sign language after using spoken language| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5421 0:14 |want to know the best way to pick up asl ,| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5422 0:15 |but wonder why it soon becomes complicated and difficult .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5423 0:18 |i will explain this phenomenon in a way that is clear and easy to understand :| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5424 0:28 |and who later decide that they want to learn sign language .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5425 0:32 |often , they will register for an asl class thinking it will be easier to learn than other foreign languages .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5426 0:37 |but after deciding to take the asl class ,| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5427 0:38 |students become frustrated when they realize it 's actually quite difficult .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5428 0:39 |but why is it so difficult ?| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5429 0:41 |learning another language is already tough ,| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5430 0:44 |though it can be fun .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5431 0:54 |there is an extra layer of difficulty here .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5432 0:58 |let 's imagine a person who uses spoken language ,| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5433 1:00 |and has never experienced a visual language that uses signs , body language , or facial expressions ,| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5434 1:04 |or includes grammar that occurs in the face .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5435 1:08 |when these speaking people begin learning another spoken language , like spanish or french ,| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5436 1:14 |while they may struggle with learning grammar , linguistic rules , and accents ,| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5437 1:20 |this typical kind of linguistic acquisition is called l2 .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5438 1:23 |however when hearing people learn asl , they are also learning a whole new linguistic modality .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5439 1:29 |this new modality , on top of a new language , is called m2l2 .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5440 1:33 |so what does that mean ?| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5441 1:35 |as people start signing and learning more about asl , they encounter many new concepts .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5442 1:39 |they have to adapt to communication that demands coordinated use of their bodies , hands , eyes , and facial expressions ,| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5443 1:45 |taking in dizzying new concepts that require dutiful practice to make sense of ,| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5444 1:47 |and deciphering what it means to communicate in a language that involves unfamiliar grammatical modality| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5445 1:51 |and the necessity of manual-facial coordination .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5446 1:53 |all of this together adds another level to the language-learning process , making it additionally challenging .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5447 1:57 |included in these challenges is something called proximalization .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5448 2:01 |proximalization is difficult .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5449 2:02 |research by gene mirus in 2001 and by mcintire and rielly in 1998 focuses on two categories :| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5450 2:15 |facial expressions and manuals , and proximalization .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5451 2:20 |i 'm going to expand on proximalization and facial expressions ,| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5452 2:24 |and explain why are they so significantly challenging for second-modality l2 students to learn as they switch from speaking to asl .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5453 2:36 |before i proceed to explain proximalization and nonmanuals for l2 students| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5454 2:45 |i 'm going to share some important vocabulary :| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5455 2:48 |first , there are transfer errors , which are interlingual .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5456 2:53 |and second , there are developmental errors , which are intralingual .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5457 3:02 |these are two distinct categories .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5458 2:05 |transfer errors occur when students carry linguistic rules from l1 and apply them to l2 ,| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5459 3:14 |such as incorporating english grammar into asl .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5460 3:19 |developmental errors do not include transference from one language to another .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5461 3:23 |these are errors that a student develops and grows with as they are learning .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5462 3:25 |i will give you examples of each .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5463 3:28 |let 's start with transfer errors .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5464 3:36 |to indicate that they are describing a person who performs the verb .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5465 3:39 |asl has a similar indicator , but it does not apply in all cases .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5466 3:42 |for example , the signs for player and teacher include this indicator .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5467 3:45 |so , a student may deduce that they can use the manual indicator the same way as the verbal one and , for instance ,| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5468 3:50 |but that application ca n't actually be used in asl , which can cause confusion .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5469 3:53 |that 's called a transfer error , when language concepts are erroneously transferred between languages .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5470 3:56 |now i 'll give you an example of a developmental error .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5471 3:59 |struggling to learn the number handshapes 6-7-8-9 might cause confusion about the difference between a 6 and a w| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5472 4:06 |and lead to errors in how a student form these handshapes .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5473 4:08 |that 's a developmental error .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5474 4:10 |here 's another example .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5475 4:12 |linked verbs , like : give-to-you , give-to-me , give-between-them , can be used incorrectly .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5476 4:24 |that 's called a developmental error .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5477 4:31 |gene mirus did research on proximalization .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5478 4:38 |so what is proximalization ?| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5479 4:40 |before i continue , let 's put language aside for a minute and focus on people in general . 0:04:46:600,0:04:47.800 for example , skiing .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5480 4:47 |someone who has never skied before and is doing it for the first time is not going to be very skilled .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5481 4:52 |since it 's their first time trying to coordinate such a big part of the structure of their body ,| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5482 4:56 |their legs and arms are all over the place . 0:05:00:100,0:05:07.000 but a skilled skier knows how to coordinate each part of their body , arms , and legs| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5483 5:09 |despite being all over the place at first .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5484 5:12 |we can apply this very same concept to asl ; the two are parallel .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5485 5:17 |if someone has never used their body , never used their shoulders , elbows , wrists , finger and knuckle joints , none of it 0:05:25.000,0:02:29.900 then they 'll have some really big things to learn about how to coordinate them .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5486 5:30 |once the body learns how to harmonize those body parts and use them to communicate , that 's called proximalization .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5487 5:36 |i will explain , focusing on three things .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5488 5:40 |a broader explanation would be too lengthy , so i 'm going to focus on covering the basics using these three categories .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5489 5:45 |i 'm going to give you examples of the three : add , omit , and both . so what do these mean ?| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5490 6:03 |watch , i 'm going to give you some examples .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5491 6:10 |here 's an example of adding :| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5492 6:24 |here 's an example of omitting :| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5493 6:38 |here 's an example of both at once :| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5494 6:43 |here , i 'm adding the extra bend at the wrist , but also omitting the transition into a closed fist .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5495 6:50 |that 's what i mean by those three categories .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5496 6:53 |now i will elaborate . 0:06:55.000,0:07:00:600 you may be thinking that proximalization only applies to l2 learners , but this pattern actually parallels a baby 's first-language learning .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5497 7:00 |babies are also learning for the first time about how to use their bodies when they sign .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5498 7:16 |as a baby grows older , their proximal focus will shift from their arms to the more fine motor ability in their hands .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5499 7:20 |this parallels the l2 language learner . but there is a difference .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5500 7:23 |we ca n't really teach and correct a baby 's signs , we leave it up to development .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5501 7:28 |as the baby grows , their proximalization happens naturally as part of this development .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5502 7:33 |now , with adult l2 learners , i as the teacher can watch , correct , and explain mistakes to them .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5503 7:43 |if i see that , i can explain that the elbow movement is unnecessary , and show them to sign it with a slight wrist movement instead .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5504 7:47 |adults can understand this , and that 's the difference .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5505 7:55 |now that i 've finished explaining proximalization , let 's move on to the related topic of nonmanuals .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5506 8:01 |i read an article written by mcintire and rielly in 1998 .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5507 8:10 |before i go into that , i 'm going to explain the u-shape . so what is that ?| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5508 8:14 |the u-shape is an illustration of the different steps of language-learning .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5509 8:21 |the first side of the u starts when someone is learning a new language , using it , and understanding it .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5510 8:32 |i teach nonmanuals to my hearing students learning asl .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5511 8:37 |their spoken language has the same indicators , the same emotions and facial expressions .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5512 8:42 |if they 're angry or happy , their voices and faces will show that .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5513 8:46 |when students first learn to sign , they recognize that the expressions are the same and understand how to use them .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5514 8:52 |but when used in grammar , i will often find that my students ' expressions and signs do n't align .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5515 9:03 |so students drop down the u , confused about a concept they thought they understood .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5516 9:06 |but later as they acquire more information and learn how to use the expressions properly , they go up again .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5517 9:17 |that 's how nonmanuals are picked up and used .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5518 9:21 |so more generally speaking , a teacher may proudly see their students using the right facial expressions ,| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5519 9:26 |but then witness them drop down the u and wonder what happened and what went wrong . but really , this is normal .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5520 9:31 |the student recognizes something familiar and feels they understand how to use it .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5521 9:31 |but as they try to form sentences with these familiar facial expressions , they get stuck and fall down the u , feeling lost .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5522 9:44 |but they will figure out how to use them , and how to coordinate their face and their hands .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5523 9:48 |now you know that when students start off understanding the nonmanuals but then take a drop ,| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5524 9:53 |that means they 're finally picking up on how to appropriately fit them them in sentences .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5525 10:02 |now i 'm going to wrap this up .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5526 10:04 |there is a reason why this information about proximalization and nonmanuals is so important to look at .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5527 10:10 |i want to to make sense of developmental errors .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5528 10:14 |as a student starts learning , i want to be able to look at their mistakes analytically ,| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5529 10:18 |and with understanding of how proximalization works and how to best give my students feedback .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5530 10:24 |as for nonmanuals , i want them to understand them without the u-shape with developmental errors .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5531 10:31 |when a student starts off seeming to do well but then starts declining , that does n't at all mean that they 're doing badly .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5532 10:36 |it means they 're in the process of understanding how to construct a statement .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5533 10:39 |the struggle and drop at the beginning will start looking up again when the student begins making sense of all the new material .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5534 10:45 |so how do you , as a teacher , take advantage of this information and put it to good use ?| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5535 10:49 |proximalization is a neat tool . if you 're observing and see something wrong ,| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5536 11:02 |in this case , the wrist ,| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5537 11:04 |and to explain that additional movement from other parts of the body is incorrect .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5538 11:11 |then the student can better understand , and your class can benefit from a teacher that understands how to use proximalization to teach .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5539 11:17 |as for nonmanuals , it 's important to be able to see where your students are beginning to understand sentence structure .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5540 11:23 |recognizing the u-shape pattern means you can identify what 's happening as a student acquires language ,| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5541 11:25 |and help them during this crucial period to make sure they make the mental connections necessary to understand how to use facial expressions .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5542 11:33 |and as they figure out how to connect them to their statements , they 'll start going back up the u . that is often what will happen .| Y2SdS-UCcK4
_*5543 11:37 |now good luck with your teaching !| Y2SdS-UCcK4

_*5616 2:17 |and how you 're going to say it now these are n't necessarily public speaking this| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5617 2:22 |could be speaking| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5618 2:23 |one-on-one but you go through the same| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5619 2:27 |strategy the same path the same bridge away from the low i wonder where you 're| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5620 2:33 |all nice and comfortable do n't have to think about what you 're saying| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5621 2:35 |to go to this island were suddenly you do have to start think about what you 're| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5622 2:39 saying Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5623 2:40 |so instead of this being the islanders public speaking| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5624 2:44 |no man 's land let 's consider it the island| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5625 2:47 |i 'll purposeful speaking this is where you go when you have to make| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5626 2:51 |appoint see that 's why we say there 's no such thing as| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5627 2:56 |public speaking jerry is speaking without having to think about it| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5628 3:01 |and there is speaking with the purpose| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5629 3:04 |now on this island of course| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5630 3:07 |there are actually three different sections they 're speaking with purpose| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5631 3:11 |to one person and then as you go into the rain forest into the jungle in up to| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5632 3:16 |the volcano you start talking more and more people| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5633 3:19 |and then we get over the backside okay no one come out of the jungle you| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5634 3:22 |finally arrive at this great big beautiful beach| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5635 3:25 |a public speaking all part of the same island and there 's not that far but| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5636 3:31 |distance between them there 's just a few extra tools| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5637 3:33 |that you need to help you get to the other side so the point| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5638 3:37 |a bar exercise for the next couple days is to teach you how to make a| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5639 3:41 presentation Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5640 3:42 |with purpose and then to provide you with the tools to do it| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5641 3:45 |in any menu anywhere anytime| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5642 3:49 |sound good alright dead if you at all please| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5643 3:53 |open your workbooks and we shall begin| Aurv3LtAzzk
_*5644 0:12 |i remember when i first met| yelE5nmK0dg
_*5645 0:14 |it was around nineteen eighty-seven 88| yelE5nmK0dg
_*5646 0:17 |i 'm happen because she 'd agreed to become the page| yelE5nmK0dg
_*5647 0:22 |the british satiation and the reason she came to me| yelE5nmK0dg
_*5648 0:28 |was because i was runnin project time which was training| yelE5nmK0dg
_*5649 0:32 |deaf people to become signings cheese she was very interested in that| yelE5nmK0dg
_*5650 0:36 |because she 'd started to learn sign language herself and| yelE5nmK0dg
_*5651 0:40 |class to learn more| yelE5nmK0dg
_*5652 0:50 up yelE5nmK0dg
_*5653 1:03 |she was very patient i need that most people when they learn sign language| yelE5nmK0dg
_*5654 1:08 |tend to be nervous and i 'm sure she must have been nervous| yelE5nmK0dg
_*5655 1:12 |but she did n't appear it and there was some humor| yelE5nmK0dg
_*5656 1:16 |choose quite famous for being humorous even though she was showing| yelE5nmK0dg
_*5657 1:20 |and we were all very impressed with her| yelE5nmK0dg
_*5658 1:24 |with patience with assigning which she learned properly| yelE5nmK0dg
_*5659 1:28 |and i that tournament been unsure how i would cope with her| yelE5nmK0dg
_*5660 1:32 |but i 'm surprised i was quite come because she was calm| yelE5nmK0dg
_*5661 1:36 |and i think that helps we had a good reporter in| yelE5nmK0dg
_*5662 1:41 |be done on fantastically| yelE5nmK0dg
_*5663 0:00 |hi we 're going to work on signs for silent night| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5664 0:03 |before we do that i want you to remember that your body needs to be divided| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5665 0:06 |imaginary grid| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5666 0:07 |that 's entirely going down and i 'll a| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5667 0:11 |shoreline nikolai| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5668 0:15 |starline and then shoulder| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5669 0:18 |with part and i will talk about those very slight| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5670 0:22 |possibly some others as we go along and the first i we 're going to do if the| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5671 0:26 |site were using for silent| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5672 0:28 |start their hands like this they| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5673 0:31 |shapes that with the site starts but your fingers are together| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5674 0:35 |thumbs are in and your right hand| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5675 0:39 |whether you 're right or left handed we 're going to sign everything right| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5676 0:41 |handed so| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5677 0:42 |i apologize to those few her left hand on it what you 're going to do is bitch| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5678 0:47 |right hand| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5679 0:48 |in front of your face notice tips| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5680 0:51 |up my fingers are right knows well and it 's an evidentiary| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5681 0:55 |central i some real left hand does| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5682 0:59 |friend exact same hand shape and then the site for silent will come out like| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5683 1:04 this WUimJ_voWuA
_*5684 1:05 |and there 's both my hands both| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5685 1:08 |outward and downward angle and the polls| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5686 1:12 |stay facing one another and they end shoulder width apart at shoulder level| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5687 1:16 |so not this not that| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5688 1:20 |it 's not this your elbows stay and the whole time just moved out| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5689 1:25 |so was what is going to look like when you start signing is will have your and| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5690 1:30 |your side| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5691 1:31 |and right before a star sighting has will come up| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5692 1:35 |and science i 'll okay try that again| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5693 1:40 |and your side good| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5694 1:46 |that s i 'm is the exact same handshake| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5695 1:50 |your hands come out for silently and here| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5696 1:54 |and they 're going to come up and your calls are going to turn inward| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5697 1:58 |so that your holes are facing basic behind you really not facing you at an| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5698 2:02 |angle that they sit behind you| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5699 2:04 |and then you 're going to move them| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5700 2:07 |like this so that they cross in front of one another| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5701 2:11 |and your left hand is going to end up in front of your right| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5702 2:14 |so it looks like this you do n't need the help not that i just ate that| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5703 2:22 |me if you were here you 'd actually i 'd be looking at you like making sure you| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5704 2:27 |doing the right thing| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5705 2:27 |as i ca n't do that just imagine you are so get the two sides together will look| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5706 2:32 |like this| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5707 2:40 |you 'll notice between the sides silence tonight| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5708 2:44 |there 's a movement upwards that needs to be as fluid as possible| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5709 2:48 |so it not staccato should not look like this| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5710 2:51 |so i do n't want it to look like that| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5711 2:57 |want to be in a fluid in graceful movement between the sides| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5712 3:07 |okay so we have the first two sides that we 're using| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5713 3:10 |for sale the site for whole| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5714 3:13 |stars with your left hand at| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5715 3:18 |start at level : hold up as well thanks together| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5716 3:23 |by i was out this like you 're going to put something in your hand basic| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5717 3:28 |down at hand we 're using it right this| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5718 3:33 |is going to make this| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5719 3:36 |it 's the letter you in sign language your finger spelling| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5720 3:39 |abc 's so it 's the letter you accept this way| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5721 3:45 |comes a letter h so you 're paul is going to face| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5722 3:48 |and force you right out just a little below eye level so that to see your| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5723 3:52 |fingers are probably right eye level| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5724 3:54 |policy facing you and this hand| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5725 3:59 |is going to move clockwise one| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5726 4:03 |and 9/8 time i think is her eight| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5727 4:06 |eight nights by intense thanks yes that 's what it was 19 tense| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5728 4:10 |so to look like this so i did n't make a full| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5729 4:15 |two revolutions but is| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5730 4:18 |why all those two and then it 's going to come down| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5731 4:23 |notice as it 's moving from here to hear| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5732 4:27 |is opening the same head shape as my left hand and it| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5733 4:32 |going to move across now what 's important here| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5734 4:35 |couple things are important but one is that when you move your hand across| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5735 4:39 |you do n't go and here 's flying up| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5736 4:42 |ca n't do that everybody in the audience who came here we 'll hear| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5737 4:46 |however many guys read it in the course going and it will separate| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5738 4:50 |it will ruin the moment so it 's important to do| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5739 4:54 |so just barely make contact with that| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5740 5:00 |non-dominant hand with your left hand so that you can hear the and sliding across| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5741 5:04 |now this time| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5742 5:07 |a sign for night that we 're going to use start with your left hand| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5743 5:12 |hometown fingers together and your thumb is in| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5744 5:16 |is because the horizon your right hand is going to represent| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5745 5:21 |the move into the sun under the rise so it 's going to look like this| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5746 5:26 |so again| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5747 5:30 |has the same swallow the user size| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5748 5:33 |in several other signs will have the exact same nj both hands as the easy| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5749 5:37 ones WUimJ_voWuA
_*5750 5:38 |sites like holy a little tougher because you 've got different hand shapes| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5751 5:42 |and you have movement within the side from h| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5752 5:45 |shaped with over whole shit so those are tougher to remember| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5753 5:49 |site like this for the hands at the same one less thing to think about| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5754 5:53 |so get this i overnight is this| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5755 6:03 |and here 's what it looks like but holy and i put together| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5756 6:11 |you know together so that between assigns is and basically all i did was| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5757 6:20 |eyesight holy here and then with his hands i just hold it there| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5758 6:26 |and live left hand those from hall up| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5759 6:29 |hong down and it touches the kroger| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5760 6:32 |my elbow rate here so those from| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5761 6:36 |holy to bone night| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5762 6:39 |so as little as possible they will help you| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5763 6:43 |other four sides together thus far look like this| WUimJ_voWuA
_*5764 6:59 okay WUimJ_voWuA
_*5765 7:01 |and read again australia wish you were here so i could see| WUimJ_voWuA

_*5898 0:09 |full telephone access to deaf and hard of hearing people .| qLTdhoE5DXw
_*5899 0:11 |initially , only tty relay service was provided .| qLTdhoE5DXw
_*5900 0:14 |this was a cumbersome process .| qLTdhoE5DXw
_*5901 0:18 |after the ada passed , some individuals began researching ways to provide relay services in sign language| qLTdhoE5DXw
_*5902 0:27 |these programs were a big hit and especially benefited people for whom asl was their first language .| qLTdhoE5DXw
_*5903 0:30 |no longer did they bear with the time-consuming process of typing in english| qLTdhoE5DXw
_*5904 0:32 |and waiting for the other end to respond .| qLTdhoE5DXw
_*5905 0:35 |the success of these state programs led the community to demand more access| qLTdhoE5DXw
_*5906 0:36 |to video relay service and in every corner of our country .| qLTdhoE5DXw
_*5907 0:38 |as a result of advocacy efforts by the nad and other deaf and hard of hearing organizations| qLTdhoE5DXw

_*5910 0:56 |today , we ca n't imagine living without video relay service !| qLTdhoE5DXw
_*5911 0:59 |vrs has played an integral role for deaf and hard of hearing people , providing equal telephone experience .| qLTdhoE5DXw
_*5912 1:09 |such as better quality interpreting , with improved interoperability , more advanced technology , and more .| qLTdhoE5DXw
_*5913 1:27 |to be done to ensure equal access for deaf and hard of hearing americans to telecommunications .| qLTdhoE5DXw

_*8916 0:17 |my name is aida robel and i was born and grew up in sweden . today i am 20 years old .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8917 0:34 |the secrets of life , how we can discover ourselves and how we can understand other people .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8918 0:46 |your father robel kidane has also presented topics for us in the past about knowing yourself ,| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8919 0:51 |how to make peace with yourself , how to make peace with your parents ,| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8920 0:56 |how to find peace outside if you already have peace inside yourself and at home .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8921 1:06 |at your age of 20 years old , how did you become interested in this area aida ?| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8922 1:12 |ever since i was a child , he used to give me advice . when i was growing up , i remembered the advice and i found it useful .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8923 1:21 |for example , what kind of struggles did you experience when you were growing up ?| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8924 1:32 |if a person hurts you , you can take a distance . but if you hurt yourself , you have nowhere else to go .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8925 1:40 |so if you are constantly hurting yourself in your life , it is not good . you can even end up in depression , sadness or sickness .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8926 1:50 |aida , who are you sharing your advice with ? is it for youths or adults ? what places do you go to share your advice ?| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8927 1:59 |this is mainly for young people , around the age 20-25 , who are looking for discovering themselves that i give advice to .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8928 2:15 |in the past i have given speeches and advice in sweden and china for example .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8929 2:23 |when you travel outside sweden to give speeches and advice , how can people invite you ?| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8930 2:31 |they send me an email where we discuss how i can support them in the best way . ( helloaidarobel @ gmail.com )| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8931 2:43 |then i prepare topics to talk about and share with them .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8932 2:47 |you already know everything , but what i do is to remind you of the things that you already know .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8933 2:53 |we all have enough education and knowledge about what we need to know .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8934 3:02 |where did you get the advice that you are sharing ? from your father , from school or other places aida ?| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8935 3:09 |from my father while growing up , from books that i have read and courses that i have attended .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8936 3:17 |i have also personally lived and experienced it .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8937 3:26 |i have lived and personally experienced it , so what has helped and supported me is what i share .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8938 3:32 |within your 20 years of age , what kinds of advice from your father have you used that has supported you ?| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8939 3:44 |one of the advices that i mentioned earlier is about negative self-talk .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8940 3:56 |i had an inner judge that was telling me what to do or not to do , constantly disturbing me .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8941 4:04 |so i confronted this voice and started to see myself with new eyes , objectively , observing myself .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8942 4:27 |i convinced myself to believe that i was good enough and then started to trust myself more .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8943 4:43 |starting a new school or something that scares you ,| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8944 4:48 |when you start trusting yourself you will be amazed of what you can do in life .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8945 4:54 |so you need to be confidence in yourself and believe that you can do something .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8946 5:03 |it can sometimes be challenging , but if you believe in yourself ,| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8947 5:20 |young people like you who want to trust and believe in themselves more , what do they expect from their parents ?| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8948 5:44 |what parents need to do , from my point of view , is to listen to your children .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8949 5:50 |as parents , you are coming from a different generation .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8950 6:04 |young people , listen to the advice you get from your parents , but then choose what you want to use in your own life .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8951 6:12 |parents , support your children . let them know what you think and do n't think .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8952 6:20 |remember to always tell them that they are good enough no matter what they do .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8953 6:29 |what we need is trust and love , the rest we can manage it . just support them .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8954 6:40 |so far , what kind of places have you been to and given advice ?| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8955 6:43 |video conference or speeches in india , china , sweden , germany and other places .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8956 6:53 |especially in sweden , i have given advice at school .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8957 6:58 |do you get paid when you give advice ?| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8958 7:01 |mostly i get paid , but i also do it for free sometimes .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8959 7:08 |how do you get your name out there outside sweden that you inspire and motivate young people ?| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8960 7:20 |robel , my father , has helped me a lot . he introduce me to people he knows in other countries .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8961 7:28 |we also work together , he with adults and me with youth . we combine our two generations .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8962 7:38 |have you two ever given training together as a father and daughter to an audience with parents and their children ?| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8963 7:52 |we have done it in china for example , where parents and youth ask questions and we answer them .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8964 8:03 |they really appreciated it and we enjoyed it as well .| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8965 8:07 |in what language did you give your training in china ? in english ?| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8966 8:12 |yes , we did it mainly in english , but i also used some chinese as well : )| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8967 8:20 |great aida , i really appreciate you . i will invite you in the future| jgzTTACA1Cg
_*8968 8:27 |to share more advice and experiences with us , with our listeners , with adults , parents and youth .| jgzTTACA1Cg

_*9110 0:02 hello 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9111 0:03 |my name is caro| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9112 0:06 |i am going to talk about| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9113 0:09 |universal subtitles| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9114 0:15 |what am i talking about ?| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9115 0:18 |it 's cool !| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9116 0:21 |mozilla , miro and participatory culture foundation| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9117 0:32 |are trying to set up a protocol for| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9118 0:41 |streaming and downloaded video players| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9119 0:53 |to have a button on it where one can click for a list of subtitles of different languages .| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9120 1:05 |you decide whichever language you want to pick to subtitle your video| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9121 1:15 |it 's cool , right ?| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9122 1:17 |where would the list come from ? obviously , the internet .| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9123 1:24 |for example , i want to watch ... a movie . i picked spanish , now where does it come from ?| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9124 1:46 |from other videos where other people made the subtitles !| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9125 1:54 |the video player i am using finds subtitle tracks from other video uploads and brings it to the video i am watching .| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9126 2:03 |it means that you can make subtitles for some video blogger you are interested in| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9127 2:11 |then all other uploads of the same video will access the track you made .| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9128 2:25 |it will help many deaf people| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9129 2:29 |you know that many youtube videos have no subtitles| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9130 2:36 |i 'm like ... looking at flapping mouths uuhuh ...| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9131 2:41 |what is he/she talking about ? !| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9132 2:44 |now , with that protocol| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9133 2:47 |maybe the videomaker is lazy and do n't want to make subtitles , then| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9134 2:55 |another person can make the subtitles and upload it for the video . easy !| 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9135 3:01 ok 3MjtY4pooFA
_*9136 3:03 |but there 's one problem| 3MjtY4pooFA

_*9255 0:50 |hospital patients those in nursing homes and homes for the aged| jTGsj7Srl-U

_*9258 1:03 |that we are discussing| jTGsj7Srl-U
_*9259 1:04 |at this point we are not let me repeat that : not recommending| jTGsj7Srl-U
_*9260 1:09 |evacuations up these facilities instead| jTGsj7Srl-U
_*9261 1:12 |in order that they can function most effectively during this period| jTGsj7Srl-U
_*9262 1:16 |we 're recommending that they cancel all elective admissions and discharge| jTGsj7Srl-U
_*9263 1:20 |all patients that can be safely discharged they should keep all the| jTGsj7Srl-U
_*9264 1:25 |patients for whom such discharges| jTGsj7Srl-U
_*9265 1:27 |or transfers are risky however he 'd rather be safe than sorry| jTGsj7Srl-U
_*9266 1:31 |on the other hand you ca n't evacuate| jTGsj7Srl-U
_*9267 1:34 |every time an you do n't want to to it its| jTGsj7Srl-U
_*9268 1:38 |inconvenient for people and even dangerous to some people| jTGsj7Srl-U
_*9269 1:41 |to move cell unit there 's a there 's two sides to it but at the moment| jTGsj7Srl-U
_*9270 1:46 |we do not think that it 's necessary to make that decision right now| jTGsj7Srl-U

_*9673 4:04 |they constantly dragged the whole thing out .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9674 4:06 |with the international adoption , it was much quicker .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9675 4:09 |i mean , it was ? ?| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9676 4:09 |it 's a long process with the home study and collecting the documents , you know ,| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9677 4:17 |putting them all together , sending them off , you know , it was a long process to do that ,| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9678 4:22 |but the actual adoption process itself was very quick .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9679 4:26 |it took two weeks and we done .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9680 4:29 |we flew to china and wrapped everything up and left , you know .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9681 4:34 |it was about ten days , so ? ?| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9682 4:36 |which i feel was very short .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9683 4:38 |> > but i think for some deaf parents , they have troubles with both domestic| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9684 4:47 |and international adoptions in terms of that agency being accessible .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9685 4:51 |like foster parent classes .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9686 4:53 |we 've had to argue about ? ?| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9687 4:54 |> > right , right , right .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9688 4:55 |> > ? ? providing an interpreter for the classes ,| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9689 4:57 |or providing an interpreter for the whole process .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9690 5:01 |you know , courts by and large are okay , but the agency themselves ,| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9691 5:07 |they do n't think about having persons who are deaf as adoptive parents .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9692 5:13 |they might know about adopted kids , but how many times did we have social workers show up at home| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9693 5:21 |to interview our kids or my wife and there 's no interpreter , and they might have used me| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9694 5:28 |as the interpreter , and , of course , i would say i was a perfect parent ; and , you know ? ?| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9695 5:33 |and , of course , if they interviewed our kids ,| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9696 5:36 |they love their dad no matter what they said , you know .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9697 5:39 |but i mean , they just were n't thinking about how would they have| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9698 5:43 |that communication directly with the child .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9699 5:46 |> > right , right .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9700 5:47 |and i think it depends on the social worker and the agency ;| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9701 5:53 |what their perception is of the situation .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9702 5:56 |if they feel that the deaf parents would become good parents , if they felt that , you know ,| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9703 6:03 |they would n't be , that would be a barrier .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9704 6:07 |so really , it really depends on what their per se perceived or preconceived feelings were| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9705 6:16 |and what their opinions were about deaf people in general .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9706 6:19 |i mean , they think they go through the process and they 're like ,| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9707 6:22 |a deaf person becoming a parent , um , i do n't think so .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9708 6:25 |there needs ? ?| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9709 6:25 |it needs to be a hearing person , especially if a deaf person wants to adopt a hearing child .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9710 6:32 |that was a different story .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9711 6:33 |that 's ? ? there 's a problem .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9712 6:35 |with deaf children , it was a little bit more flexible .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9713 6:37 |it makes it harder to find parents that are willing to adopt a deaf child , that parents| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9714 6:42 |and hearing children wanting to adopt a hearing child which is very difficult .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9715 6:46 |a lot of agencies were against that .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9716 6:48 |they were not supportive of that idea .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9717 6:50 |> > china was fairly open about deaf people adopting deaf kids .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9718 6:55 |i do wonder how they would have reacted to deaf people adopting hearing kids .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9719 7:02 |but to be honest , most of the deaf people i know have been more interested| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9720 7:05 |in adopting deaf kids so i just ? ?| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9721 7:07 |i do n't ? ?| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9722 7:08 |> > right , right .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9723 7:09 |> > ? ? i do n't really know how that experience would go .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9724 7:17 |> > well , they need to make their process more accessible ,| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9725 7:23 |and realize that deaf parents are capable of being good parents .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9726 7:29 |it 's just like any other ? ?| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9727 7:32 |and anyone else , you know .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9728 7:34 |> > the message i would give them is , reach out to the deaf community .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9729 7:38 |has a dss worker ever spoken at the association of the deaf meeting ?| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9730 7:43 |have they talked about adopting ?| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9731 7:45 |provide notification that there are children who need homes through the deaf community networks .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9732 7:51 |just this afternoon when somebody found out i was coming here to talk about being a parent ,| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9733 7:55 |they said , `` oh , i 'm thinking about adopting but i do n't know where to get started .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9734 7:58 |i do n't know ? ?| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9735 7:59 |where do i go with that whole process ? ''| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9736 8:01 |so , you know , and if they call dss , they 're going to run into right away , `` oh , well ,| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9737 8:08 |we do n't have anybody who can sign . ''| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9738 8:09 |you know , `` we do n't have an interpreter for that class . ''| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9739 8:13 |`` you 'll have to bring an interpreter to that class . ''| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9740 8:15 |`` oh , well , if you ca n't answer the phone , how if am i supposed to talk to you ? ''| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9741 8:21 |so those kind of just real basic things of ? ?| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9742 8:26 |i think if the adoption workers were a little bit more welling to reach out to the community .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9743 8:32 |now , is everybody 's deaf going to be an adoptive parent ?| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9744 8:36 |of course not .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9745 8:37 |but there are some who want to be and just find the system not accessible .| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9746 8:43 |[ music ]| c5-X7oj9jd4
_*9747 0:25 |*gotye* now and then i think of when we were together once-in-a-while i think back both-of-us together , side-by-side| 8U92lcCNh1Q
_*9748 0:32 |like when you said you felt so happy you could die i remember one time you said feel happy can remain till die| 8U92lcCNh1Q
_*9749 0:40 |told myself that you were right for me tell self ( a ) lie you right woman for me| 8U92lcCNh1Q
_*9750 0:43 |but felt so lonely in your company but feel wrong , still lonely even when together| 8U92lcCNh1Q
_*9751 0:48 |but that was love and it 's an ache i still remember but that old sweetheart , heart-hurt , still lingers| 8U92lcCNh1Q
_*9752 1:03 |you can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness anyone can become addict , focus negative sadness| 8U92lcCNh1Q
_*9753 1:11 |like resignation to the end , always the end same prepare goodbye , always end| 8U92lcCNh1Q
_*9754 1:22 |well you said that we would still be friends you said still promise stay on-going friends| 8U92lcCNh1Q
_*9755 1:26 |but i 'll admit that i was glad it was over i admit relieved , feelings ( of ) struggle finished| 8U92lcCNh1Q
_*9756 1:52 |have your friends collect your records and then change your number announce friends , gossip and change your phone number| 8U92lcCNh1Q
_*9757 1:56 |i guess that i do n't need that though i guess not need your attitude| 8U92lcCNh1Q
_*9758 2:06 |now you 're just somebody that i used to know now you- & -i not friends anymore| 8U92lcCNh1Q
_*9759 2:21 |*kimbra* now and then i think of all the times you screwed me over think back remember again-again you took advantage , thoughts pop-up ( of ) many times ( you did this )| 8U92lcCNh1Q
_*9760 2:28 |but had me believing it was always something that i 'd done i blame self , ( my ) fault not work-out| 8U92lcCNh1Q
_*9761 2:40 |reading into every word you say worry mistake miscommunicate , you compare ( me to ) another girl| 8U92lcCNh1Q
_*9762 2:44 |you said that you could let it go you said promise old girl ( is ) out-of-our-way| 8U92lcCNh1Q
_*9763 2:46 |and i would n't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know i would not catch you obsessed ( about that ) ex ( girlfriend ) -- your ex you know before me| 8U92lcCNh1Q
_*9764 2:51 |*gotye* but you did n't have to cut me off you have-to cut-me-off| 8U92lcCNh1Q
_*9765 2:54 |make out like it never happened and that we were nothing pretend we never knew each-other , now both-of-us mean precious-nothing| 8U92lcCNh1Q
_*9766 3:02 |but you treat me like a stranger and i feel so rough but you look-at-me like stranger , feel depressed| 8U92lcCNh1Q
_*9767 3:10 |have your friends collect your records and then change your number tell friends secret move , new phone number| 8U92lcCNh1Q

_*10183 0:00 |> > rosemary church : ... and we want to talk more about the sign-language interpreter| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10184 0:02 |at nelson mandela 's memorial on tuesday .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10185 0:05 |we 're joined by laura peterson and julie rems-smario in fremont , california ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10186 0:09 |they work at the california school for the deaf , as we mentioned ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10187 0:13 |and julie herself is deaf and will be communicating through an interpreter| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10188 0:17 |who is off-camera here .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10189 0:19 |thank you for joining us .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10190 0:20 |laura , i do want to start with you and get your reaction| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10191 0:25 |to this sign-language interpreter : what did you think ?| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10192 0:27 |> > laura peterson : um , well , when i first heard about it , actually from julie ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10193 0:32 |i thought `` ok , then maybe they were n't qualified , ''| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10194 0:36 |so i thought , in order to explain this here ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10195 0:40 |i really wanted to provide access to everybody in your audience| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10196 0:43 |and so , because i understand that there is no captioning ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10197 0:47 |so julie is interpreting ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10198 0:50 |so that everybody in the audience can have access .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10199 0:52 |so i just wanted to clarify that ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10200 0:54 |because people are maybe not understanding| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10201 0:56 |why julie is signing right now .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10202 0:58 |so , when i first read about it , i thought :| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10203 1:00 |`` ok , maybe it was somebody who just was n't very good . ''| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10204 1:03 |but when i actually saw the video , it was really clear that they were --| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10205 1:07 |did not have the semantics , the hand shapes ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10206 1:11 |the normal attributes of *any* sign language .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10207 1:16 |i do n't know south african sign language ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10208 1:18 |but there are things that are uniform in all sign languages .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10209 1:22 |> > church : and it is worth mentioning that there is n't an international sign language ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10210 1:26 |which is there ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10211 1:27 |i mean there are different sign languages in each country .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10212 1:29 |but julie , i do want to go to you :| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10213 1:31 |are you outraged ? what do you want to see happen here ?| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10214 1:35 |> > julie rems-smario : well , really , i am upset ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10215 1:40 |because really , that shows a lack of respect| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10216 1:43 |for human rights of language equality .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10217 1:46 |that was destroyed at this event| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10218 1:48 |and nelson mandela represented human rights| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10219 1:53 |and he 's an icon and an african .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10220 1:56 |and this person exploited that on a very important day| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10221 2:01 |to honor nelson mandela| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10222 2:03 |and he also violated our human rights as deaf people| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10223 2:07 |by showing exactly what , you know ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10224 2:12 |language apartheid looks like .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10225 2:14 |> > church : and laura , as we saw in the story that errol barnett brought us| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10226 2:18 |just before the break ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10227 2:21 |this man , this interpreter , he has been in trouble before ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10228 2:25 |but there have been no consequences .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10229 2:27 |how does somebody -- as far as i was concerned --| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10230 2:29 |he had credentials to do this .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10231 2:32 |how does somebody end up on the stage| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10232 2:33 |next to all of those dignitaries| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10233 2:35 |in such an important , historic day ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10234 2:38 |for not just south africa , but indeed the world ?| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10235 2:41 |how does someone get through to that point| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10236 2:43 |when they 've been in trouble before ?| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10237 2:45 |> > peterson : right , so your question is| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10238 2:46 |how does he end up on the stage .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10239 2:48 |um , it 's not , unfortunately , it 's not that unusual .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10240 2:53 |it happens not just in south africa ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10241 2:55 |it happens around the world ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10242 2:56 |it happens in classrooms here in california .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10243 3:00 |this -- oftentimes the situation is ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10244 3:02 |the person who is doing the hiring does n't know the language .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10245 3:07 |and so , if the person says they are fluent in that language ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10246 3:10 |they take them , you know , just by their word .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10247 3:13 |here in the united states ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10248 3:15 |we have the registry of interpreters for the deaf ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10249 3:17 |there 's a whole certification process| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10250 3:18 |and a code of ethics and professional conduct ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10251 3:23 |so we try to avoid that .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10252 3:25 |however , that does n't mean that people do n't hire| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10253 3:30 |people who do n't have those qualifications ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10254 3:32 |they do n't include deaf people in that hiring process| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10255 3:34 |so that somebody who knows the language can actually ascertain| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10256 3:39 |whether they do have that fluency .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10257 3:42 |> > church : and presumably , money is the motivator here .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10258 3:44 |but of course , across the world ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10259 3:46 |many deaf children struggle to get a proper education| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10260 3:49 |and that 's the big point here .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10261 3:51 |and human rights watch has a campaign dedicated| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10262 3:54 |to help raise awareness about sign language education| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10263 3:57 |in places throughout africa , and indeed the rest of the world .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10264 4:00 |i want to just watch a portion of the video if we can bring that up :| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10265 4:05 |> > teacher : my name ? good !| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10266 4:07 |yours ? hey ! anne , anne , good !| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10267 4:09 |my name .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10268 4:11 |[ girl signs her name ]| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10269 4:13 |> > teacher : good good good ! yours ?| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10270 4:15 |your name ? ah ah , you are not anne .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10271 4:20 |my name ? who ? yours , yours , yours .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10272 4:23 |> > boy : yours , yours , yours .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10273 4:26 |> > teacher : mmm , what is her name ?| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10274 4:29 |[ girl signs ]| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10275 4:30 |> > teacher : yeah , beautiful .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10276 4:31 |she 's very good in taking in the sign language .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10277 4:35 |it 's very important to have because| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10278 4:37 |she can now be communicating to other people .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10279 4:40 |while she was at home| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10280 4:42 |there was no sign language being taught there .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10281 4:46 |> > church : and julie and laura , of course advocates say ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10282 4:49 |one of the biggest problems| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10283 4:50 |is the lack of sign language schools and instructors .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10284 4:53 |and of course that portion of that video , i mean ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10285 4:56 |really does bring it home , does n't it ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10286 4:58 |the importance of educating these children who ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10287 5:01 |for some -- sometimes , it 's not until they 're 6 years of age| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10288 5:03 |that they have access to this sort of education .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10289 5:06 |so how concerned are you that this fake interpreter 's actions| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10290 5:11 |could have a negative impact on this initiative ?| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10291 5:14 |> > rems-smario : well , i 'm very concerned| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10292 5:18 |about the lack of acceptance of deaf people , deaf leaders ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10293 5:23 |and the input from the community ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10294 5:24 |because we 're the experts ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10295 5:25 |and many schools do n't hire the deaf people who know the community ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10296 5:29 |who know the language ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10297 5:30 |who know our human right to sign language .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10298 5:35 |we have a national and international epidemic| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10299 5:38 |of deaf children who have language deprivation .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10300 5:41 |they grow up without full access , full competency in any language ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10301 5:47 |which means they struggle academically , socially , emotionally| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10302 5:52 |and it 's really a travesty .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10303 5:53 |> > church : if there 's one good point ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10304 5:56 |perhaps this incident has brought attention to that .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10305 5:59 |we will see of course .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10306 6:00 |laura peterson and julie rems-smario ,| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10307 6:02 |thank you so much for joining us| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10308 6:04 |and bringing attention to this incident .| a8b4oPe3Peg
_*10309 6:06 |we appreciate it .| a8b4oPe3Peg

_*10327 1:06 |not go up| 1q8EjkfYAjs
_*10328 0:07 |> > good morning .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10329 0:08 |it 's nice to meet all of you .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10330 0:13 |i 'm just wondering have any of you taken asl classes ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10331 0:17 |raise your hand if you have .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10332 0:23 |it seems like they 're enough students here who have taken asl .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10333 0:26 |we can get rid of the interpreters , right ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10334 0:28 |how do you guys feel about that ? no ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10335 0:30 |oh , you do n't want that . ok .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10336 0:31 |it 's not a good idea ? ok .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10337 0:32 |we 'll keep them , all right .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10338 0:33 |we 'll have the interpreters stay .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10339 0:43 |i do n't know if many of you heard much about deaf people| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10340 0:46 |or deaf culture or the deaf world .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10341 0:52 |deaf culture and deaf people are very complex .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10342 1:00 |it 's a community that they are very comfortable with| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10343 1:05 |and the lifestyle of their own , it 's their own world .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10344 1:11 |and it 's really different from the world that you all live in .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10345 1:15 |so we would like you , to invite you to enter this world with us and see| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10346 1:19 |what it 's like and imagine what this deaf world could look like , all right ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10347 1:30 |this is obvious .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10348 1:34 |we 're all familiar with the 5 senses .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10349 1:43 |so , now we take away hearing .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10350 1:48 |deaf people are born without hearing ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10351 1:50 |grow up with no hearing or maybe a little bit .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10352 1:55 |maybe you could hear police sirens .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10353 2:00 |this was my experience .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10354 2:02 |if something was very loud i could hear a little bit .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10355 2:05 |i knew that it was there .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10356 2:06 |but it 's very different from being able to hear .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10357 2:13 |maybe you 've met deaf people or you could imagine meeting a deaf person .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10358 2:19 |and automatically you think that something 's missing , right ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10359 2:23 |if you see a deaf person , do you see that they 're hearing is missing ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10360 2:27 |not really .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10361 2:31 |but many deaf people have just the 4 senses , never experience the fifth sense .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10362 2:39 |i never experienced hearing .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10363 2:41 |i was born with 4 senses and i 'm fine .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10364 2:44 |was i missing anything ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10365 2:46 |maybe speaking , but that 's really something that you care about .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10366 2:49 |from my perspective it 's different , it 's not that important .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10367 2:59 |out of the 5 senses , often people think that hearing is the most important| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10368 3:06 |and they think vision is maybe the second most important .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10369 3:09 |hearing is important for communication , then vision .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10370 3:16 |if we eliminate hearing , so guess what my second most important sense is ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10371 3:23 |if vision has become my most important ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10372 3:26 |can you guess ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10373 3:28 |> > touch ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10374 3:30 |> > yes , touch .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10375 3:33 |taste , no .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10376 3:34 |it does n't really help much .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10377 3:36 |but sense of touch is very important .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10378 3:40 |if something is very loud i can feel the vibration .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10379 3:44 |i can feel that something is happening .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10380 3:48 |my sense of touch can be helpful in that way .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10381 4:06 |so often people will look and say do deaf people really have a culture ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10382 4:09 |this deaf culture that we hear about , what is this ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10383 4:13 |it 's become a topic of discussion .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10384 4:16 |what is culture ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10385 4:18 |it 's very complex subject .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10386 4:23 |some cultures include their food , their clothes , certain values| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10387 4:30 |and a variety of other things that are important to that culture .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10388 4:34 |so it 's easy to develop a culture based on these lists| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10389 4:37 |and they have a checklist like oh , we have these things or we do n't .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10390 4:42 |and does that make something a culture ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10391 4:46 |it varies .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10392 4:48 |the best answer is really based on these ideas .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10393 5:01 |when we 're born do we already have a culture ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10394 5:04 |no , of course not .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10395 5:05 |it depends where we are born , what we are taught and learn| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10396 5:10 |and that affects us and develops our culture .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10397 5:13 |is culture frozen ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10398 5:14 |of course not .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10399 5:15 |it 's constantly changing .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10400 5:17 |we 're always changing .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10401 5:20 |as people get older , things change .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10402 5:23 |customs change , cultures change .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10403 5:30 |culture is something that makes us feel comfortable .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10404 5:33 |we feel that we 're not isolated and on our own .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10405 5:36 |we can find someone with similarities and feel that we are alike and become| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10406 5:41 |friends and have something that we share that makes us feel comfortable .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10407 5:47 |the fourth example here .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10408 5:51 |if people of different cultures encounter each other ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10409 5:54 |sometimes it 's very awkward .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10410 5:56 |has anyone ever been to japan ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10411 6:00 |you do not shake hands in japan , you bow .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10412 6:04 |shaking hands is considered inappropriate in their culture .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10413 6:08 |how 'bout in france ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10414 6:09 |you hug and you kiss and it 's very affectionate .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10415 6:14 |so where are the boundaries ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10416 6:16 |how close can you get to someone ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10417 6:18 |what are the physical space issues in different cultures ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10418 6:23 |and that 's what makes a culture : how you feel comfortable .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10419 6:30 |one of the most important of all things for culture is this .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10420 6:39 |all of us have our own identity .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10421 6:43 |an identity is so important .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10422 6:45 |it makes us feel proud of who we are and have a strong identity .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10423 6:49 |culture really provides this identity development that is part of our identity .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10424 6:58 |and there are many different aspects to identity .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10425 7:01 |the list goes on and on whether you 're a man or a woman ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10426 7:05 |what color your skin is , whether you have developmental disabilities ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10427 7:09 |whether you are gay or straight .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10428 7:11 |the list just , it goes on and on .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10429 7:13 |there are too many to even mention .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10430 7:17 |but identity can be a challenge and there are many issues with identity .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10431 7:25 |deaf culture , if we want to really talk about deaf culture ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10432 7:29 |it has a long list also and i could here and lecture you all day .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10433 7:33 |but i 'm an old man and this wo n't be easy for me to do .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10434 7:37 |so i 'm just going to pick 2 .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10435 7:40 |the most important 2 .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10436 7:49 |these are the 2 key ideas for deaf culture .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10437 7:54 |this is really the 2 most important things .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10438 7:59 |we do not live in a world with sound , we live in a visual world .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10439 8:03 |and of course our language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10440 8:05 |when we are born , most of you , your primary language is the spoken language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10441 8:09 |for deaf babies it just ca n't happen that way .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10442 8:13 |so we have to make up our own way of language and developing sign language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10443 8:19 |so these are the 2 key elements to deaf culture .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10444 8:25 |> > are you two doing ok ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10445 8:27 |and we are !| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10446 8:37 |there are many definitions of culture .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10447 8:39 |some are based on language , we have a language of course ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10448 8:43 |but another perspective is that it might be based on sensory input .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10449 8:51 |you know , depending on your training , our culture , you know ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10450 8:56 |most people think that there are 5 or 6 senses .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10451 9:02 |and so some cultures walk in a certain way with you know ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10452 9:12 |they might have good balance , they can carry things on their head .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10453 9:15 |if they do n't , you know , that particular sense is lacking .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10454 9:20 |so different cultures value different things .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10455 9:24 |in deaf culture for example , we value the visual input ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10456 9:29 |you know , in our everyday life everything is based on the visual sense .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10457 9:35 |so we will see whether a particular system has that visual input| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10458 9:40 |and if it does n't we will develop our own way of getting that visual input .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10459 9:51 |scientific research has proven different things about deaf people .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10460 9:58 |one for example being deaf people might rely on ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10461 10:02 |you know , their vision in a way that makes it more sharp .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10462 10:07 |so science has proven that peripheral vision for deaf people is keen| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10463 10:14 |and they 're able to see ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10464 10:15 |signing for example from a wider range of peripheral vision .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10465 10:22 |deaf people , like for example , i 'm looking straight ahead .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10466 10:26 |i ca n't see the power point for example| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10467 10:29 |but i am able to look ahead to you and see actually , i can see to the side .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10468 10:34 |i depend on my peripheral vision .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10469 10:36 |for example i 'm much more sensitive to people signing to the side| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10470 10:39 |and catching what they might be saying .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10471 10:42 |so our peripheral vision is much more keen| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10472 10:45 |and that has been proven scientifically .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10473 10:52 |now tests with 3-d involved , which involves cubes or you know ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10474 11:02 |things being able to be fit together or not| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10475 11:06 |have also proven that deaf people have that spatial processing ability| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10476 11:12 |where they might have 5 different items| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10477 11:16 |and they have to fit these items together ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10478 11:17 |they 're able to do it much more quickly| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10479 11:21 |than other people without actually even touching the object .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10480 11:28 |so they have a much more advanced ability| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10481 11:32 |to be able to do spatial processing tasks .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10482 11:40 |now you can see that 's a red light on the remote , correct ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10483 11:46 |when that light is on , you could actually write a word ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10484 11:53 |in a sense with that light in the dark .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10485 11:58 |so if a word was written in the dark like that ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10486 12:02 |a deaf person could actually see what the word is because again ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10487 12:07 |their visual information is rapidly presented ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10488 12:11 |but they 're able to comprehend it much more quickly than someone else .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10489 12:17 |so research has proven that those skills| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10490 12:21 |are far more advanced that people that are n't deaf .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10491 12:28 |their learning style is such that they are able to ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10492 12:33 |you know , incorporate those skills much faster .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10493 12:40 |we have deaf architectures , people that ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10494 12:46 |you know , build deaf houses for example .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10495 12:48 |so what i mean by that , it 's based , it 's a house that 's based on vision| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10496 12:53 |and visible things such as mirrors where they are strategically placed .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10497 12:58 |you know , so for example in a deaf house they might put a mirror| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10498 13:02 |in a way that you could see around a corner for example .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10499 13:08 |again , the space is designed in a way that deaf friendly ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10500 13:15 |which means you go in , there 's usually an open space| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10501 13:19 |and it 's easy to see things in a visual way .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10502 13:24 |deaf people tend to look for homes in that way ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10503 13:27 |to check to see if they are deaf friendly or not .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10504 13:30 |and if they are n't , if they are like small spaces , closed in , you know ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10505 13:34 |they would not prefer that type of house .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10506 13:36 |they will look for a deaf friendly house and go ahead and buy it .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10507 13:42 |another value in deaf culture is the eyes obviously .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10508 13:49 |again , you know , feeling obviously is very important| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10509 13:53 |but the eyes are very , very much valued .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10510 13:56 |so any type of game or whatever , you know ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10511 14:00 |there 's always this careful protection of the eyes| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10512 14:03 |because it 's a special protection because , and that 's always emphasized| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10513 14:07 |to not play a game that might hurt or harm the eyes .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10514 14:12 |that 's another value in deaf culture .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10515 14:16 |we also value face-to-face interaction .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10516 14:21 |you know , without it , i do n't understand| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10517 14:25 |how people are so comfortable with cell phones .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10518 14:27 |deaf people much prefer to see a person face-to-face and communicate with them .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10519 14:31 |it 's highly valued .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10520 14:33 |and so it 's a very , just a different style of being .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10521 14:43 |now in the visual world all of those things have led to| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10522 14:48 |development of language and to the development of sign language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10523 14:57 |if you were n't able to hear or speak , you know , you would depend on vision| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10524 15:04 |and you would write for communication and developing sign language as well .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10525 15:09 |that is just a natural progression .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10526 15:21 |could you imagine yourselves being born without| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10527 15:24 |being able to communicate at all ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10528 15:28 |and being a child growing up without being able to communicate ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10529 15:33 |not being able to communicate with your family or friends .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10530 15:38 |when you communicate with people , you get that human connection .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10531 15:41 |you 're able to socialize and you feel good , it 's part of being a human being .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10532 15:45 |it 's mandatory as a human .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10533 15:49 |and communication , community , those two words are very similar .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10534 15:58 |they 're spelled actually very similarly .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10535 16:03 |being a member of a community and communication| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10536 16:06 |are one and the same practically .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10537 16:11 |you ca n't have , be in a community without communication .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10538 16:14 |you depend on that communication to be in a community .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10539 16:22 |now when a deaf child is born , they obviously ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10540 16:27 |you know , it 's a natural desire to want to join a community and to interact .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10541 16:32 |but if they do n't have the ability to communicate| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10542 16:34 |they will not be able to do that and they will fail .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10543 16:39 |they will find another way as well .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10544 16:48 |as time went on for deaf people , american sign language was developed and it| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10545 16:54 |was developed over many , many years .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10546 16:58 |one deaf family would pass it on to the next generation| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10547 17:02 |and each generation passed it on and it became advanced over time .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10548 17:08 |it has been around for many , many generations up until today .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10549 17:15 |in other countries there are different sign languages .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10550 17:18 |each country has their own sign language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10551 17:21 |it is not universal .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10552 17:23 |there 's british sign language called bsl| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10553 17:27 |and it 's completely different than american sign language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10554 17:29 |in france there 's french sign language as well| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10555 17:33 |and each of the countries has their own sign language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10556 17:37 |and it 's that group , the community that decides on what the language will be| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10557 17:42 |and that is exactly what happened here in america .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10558 17:53 |now as we developed american sign language many , many , many generations ago ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10559 18:00 |it was n't originally recognized as a formal language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10560 18:04 |people saw it as gestures .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10561 18:07 |over time people realized that , in about 1960 's actually ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10562 18:16 |that it actually did fit the criteria of a formal language| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10563 18:21 |because it has vocabulary , grammar ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10564 18:24 |it meets all of the criteria of other languages .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10565 18:29 |and it was finally recognized in 1960 .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10566 18:35 |once that was recognized , it just took off from there .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10567 18:41 |it spread like wildfire .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10568 18:43 |and i ask you , how many american sign language classes| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10569 18:48 |are offered across the united states ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10570 18:51 |everywhere .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10571 18:52 |they are everywhere now .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10572 18:55 |for example , in this table you can see .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10573 19:08 |this demonstrates from the year 1998 until the year 2002 ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10574 19:14 |that 4 year difference how much of a percentage in increase of students| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10575 19:24 |took american sign language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10576 19:26 |432 percent increase over that 4 year span .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10577 19:31 |now from 2002 to 2011 , we do n't have that exact number| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10578 19:38 |but it has grown and grown exponentially .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10579 19:53 |if somebody could quickly tell me something .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10580 19:56 |if you had , could you tell me some of the benefits| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10581 20:04 |to having taken sign language ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10582 20:06 |can anyone tell me that ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10583 20:10 |> > i worked at a grocery store and at a friendly 's restaurant| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10584 20:14 |and whenever i had customers come in ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10585 20:16 |they 're always very happy to see that i can sign .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10586 20:23 |> > thank you .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10587 20:24 |true .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10588 20:27 |deaf people love it when they 're in the world| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10589 20:30 |and someone can use sign language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10590 20:33 |hearing people can benefit as well .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10591 20:40 |for example , underwater it 's difficult to communicate , correct ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10592 20:44 |but if you can sign , obviously , you can communicate underwater .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10593 20:47 |it 's simple and easy .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10594 20:49 |there are no barriers .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10595 20:52 |if you 're in a loud , crowded environment| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10596 20:56 |you can easily switch over to using sign language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10597 20:58 |if you are far away from someone , you can sign , you know ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10598 21:01 |in a large space and communicate with someone ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10599 21:05 |whereas you could n't do that if you were just speaking .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10600 21:08 |you see various , like if you 're in a situation| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10601 21:12 |where you 're blocked from the other person| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10602 21:14 |and you can only see them , you can switch over to using american sign language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10603 21:18 |there are many benefits to using american sign language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10604 21:27 |research has proven that babies , whether they 're hearing or deaf ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10605 21:35 |are processing information and they understand the world| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10606 21:41 |and they 're continuously taking in information .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10607 21:45 |but their ability to express language| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10608 21:47 |has not yet developed , spoken language that is .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10609 21:52 |if they 're crying , you know , the parents come over| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10610 21:54 |and they 're trying to figure out why are you crying ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10611 21:56 |and they might say do you need your diaper changed ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10612 21:58 |do you need some milk ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10613 21:58 |and the baby keeps crying .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10614 22:00 |you know , most of the time the baby is unable to communicate| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10615 22:04 |what their needs are and they continue to cry .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10616 22:07 |in sign language , however , babies can pick up sign language| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10617 22:11 |well before the development of spoken language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10618 22:16 |studies have shown and babies are signing more and more ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10619 22:19 |they 're using sign language with babies| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10620 22:21 |because the vocal cords have not developed but they can sign .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10621 22:25 |the sign for milk , for example .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10622 22:27 |and then when they are able to speak ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10623 22:30 |they then can switch over to spoken language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10624 22:32 |but this is becoming a phenomenon as well and more and more parents| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10625 22:36 |are teaching their babies sign language| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10626 22:39 |and then when they are able to speak , they have developed 2 languages .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10627 23:13 |i 'm just asking him to back up and repeat for the interpreter .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10628 23:18 |when we are born we do not have spoken language yet or written language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10629 23:24 |it 's already there , english language is already there , written and spoken .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10630 23:29 |but it 's , in american sign language we do n't have a written language| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10631 23:33 |so we did n't want to reinvent the wheel , so we do sign but when we write ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10632 23:37 |we write in standard written english .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10633 23:40 |so we really have 2 languages .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10634 23:43 |and deaf education is really a bilingual education .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10635 23:47 |we read and write in english and we do practice grammar , but then also we ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10636 23:53 |to be involved in the hearing world ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10637 23:55 |but then we also have our sign language| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10638 23:59 |as part of our culture and our language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10639 24:02 |and deaf people 's english has improved so much ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10640 24:08 |but we get no english through asl| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10641 24:11 |so research has proven that any people , whether they 're deaf or hearing ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10642 24:18 |if their first language , if their native language is not english| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10643 24:25 |and their second language is english , they will continue to progress| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10644 24:31 |and this , using their native language will help improve their english| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10645 24:38 |until their english reaches the same level as their native language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10646 24:41 |their native language will always be above the english ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10647 24:44 |they will continue to struggle but by practicing in their native language| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10648 24:51 |they can continue to increase and develop these skills .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10649 24:59 |and continuing to focus on asl| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10650 25:01 |will help continue to develop english language skills as well .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10651 25:16 |now i want to talk about something called deaf community .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10652 25:19 |deaf community really has so many things and aspects to it .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10653 25:25 |we have our own education .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10654 25:28 |our own sports .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10655 25:29 |our own organizations .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10656 25:31 |social events .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10657 25:38 |we have entertainment , storytelling , shows , religious , religious services .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10658 25:45 |do you know that there is a new religion ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10659 25:48 |did anyone know this ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10660 25:49 |no , i 'm kidding .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10661 25:51 |but we are involved in religious services .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10662 25:55 |if someone wants to go , maybe the pastor would sign and then the deaf people| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10663 26:00 |can just watch what 's happening and be more involved in the church community .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10664 26:05 |there are deaf services available .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10665 26:08 |and deaf priests .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10666 26:12 |the list does go on and on .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10667 26:14 |but the point is , that we really do live in our own world ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10668 26:17 |in our own community .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10669 26:20 |and we feel normal , perfectly fine .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10670 26:23 |we 're happy , well adjusted .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10671 26:30 |i want to tell you a story with a happy ending .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10672 26:33 |does it have a happy ending ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10673 26:36 |no .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10674 26:47 |there are really 2 views on deafness .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10675 26:50 |our view and what do you think the other view is ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10676 26:56 |can you guess ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10677 27:03 |the medical perspective .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10678 27:09 |when a baby is born deaf , in the medical world| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10679 27:13 |they truly believe that they have the authority on deafness .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10680 27:18 |because deafness is a loss .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10681 27:21 |remember when we talked about the senses at the beginning ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10682 27:23 |the 1 sense that 's missing , it 's lost .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10683 27:27 |so it 's their responsibility to somehow get this sense back .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10684 27:33 |so it is their belief that they own the deaf child| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10685 27:38 |and the decisions for this deaf child .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10686 27:42 |it 's very different view , very different paths .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10687 27:48 |we have deaf identity .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10688 27:50 |if there 's a deaf child , they see us as ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10689 27:58 |the medical field sees us as only deaf .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10690 28:01 |but there are so many aspects to who this individual is .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10691 28:06 |and they give us all these labels based on| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10692 28:08 |our hearing loss or our hearing disorder .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10693 28:12 |they feel that there 's something wrong , that is the main issue .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10694 28:16 |but it 's hearing loss , it 's a hearing loss .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10695 28:21 |so that sense is missing .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10696 28:23 |it 's also been called hearing impairment , as if something is being blocked .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10697 28:29 |so many labels have been based on the inability to hear .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10698 28:35 |sometimes people have been called hearing impaired , deaf impaired .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10699 28:41 |it 's just a different name , just a different perspective .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10700 28:50 |this has been , deafness has been labeled a disability ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10701 28:53 |a handicap and so on throughout the years .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10702 28:58 |that has caused people to feel it is their duty to fix it , to fix us .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10703 29:13 |you guys are familiar with the world health organization .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10704 29:18 |the who .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10705 29:23 |doctors throughout the world discussing different ideas on medicine ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10706 29:29 |so really they are sort of the top experts in the medical field .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10707 29:37 |and this is what they say about deafness .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10708 29:44 |that there must be medicine involved or surgery involved .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10709 29:49 |and the goal is to reduce , or even better , eliminate deafness .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10710 29:55 |that would be the goal .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10711 29:57 |but the community 's goal is the opposite .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10712 29:59 |we want to continue to grow the deaf community .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10713 30:03 |we 're fine , we 're happy .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10714 30:07 |the medical opinion is to shrink our community and our feeling| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10715 30:11 |is to just allow it to flourish and grow .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10716 30:21 |this word .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10717 30:25 |it 's kind of a bad word and we 're going to avoid it .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10718 30:28 |it really means a better breed .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10719 30:37 |so how to improve a race ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10720 30:40 |how to make them stronger , better .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10721 30:47 |that 's sort of the american way , to be the most healthy , the best , the top .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10722 30:54 |so this word has become bad because of nazi germany .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10723 31:04 |there was this interest in creating this perfect race .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10724 31:09 |so if someone was born with something wrong ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10725 31:12 |they were trying to figure out how to fix them .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10726 31:16 |how to block from making more of this bad breed .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10727 31:21 |so that german approach really became , it was as simple as killing the people .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10728 31:30 |that was their feeling , just eliminate them .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10729 31:32 |we 'll just kill them all if there was something wrong with them .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10730 31:34 |we 'll keep the good , and eliminate the bad .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10731 31:37 |so of course the world , you know , said that this was a horrible thing to do| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10732 31:41 |and the word became a bad word , a negative word .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10733 32:00 |these are some examples .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10734 32:03 |there are a variety of ways that people have tried to| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10735 32:06 |increase a race in the past .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10736 32:11 |suppose you want to come into america .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10737 32:13 |first they make sure they check that you 're healthy .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10738 32:15 |if you 're sick , forget it .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10739 32:16 |go back .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10740 32:17 |did you know that ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10741 32:18 |you ca n't come , they wo n't be allowed into america if you 're already sick .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10742 32:22 |afraid that they might affect , infect other people once they come here .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10743 32:26 |so how 'bout deaf people who tried to come in ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10744 32:29 |they would n't accept deaf people .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10745 32:31 |turned them right back and not be allowed into america .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10746 32:34 |there were a few people who were allowed to come in| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10747 32:37 |but it was a struggle for a long , many , many years .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10748 32:40 |deaf were not allowed to enter america .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10749 32:44 |segregation is another example .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10750 32:51 |they did n't want deaf people socializing with hearing people .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10751 32:56 |they wanted to keep them segregated , put them in a school for deaf children .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10752 33:01 |so that no one would have to see these deaf children ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10753 33:04 |just hide them off in a school by themselves .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10754 33:08 |they were n't only deaf students , they would put the blind students somewhere ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10755 33:11 |students who were , had autism .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10756 33:14 |maybe put them in a hospital .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10757 33:15 |keep them all separated .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10758 33:17 |so that the community looked fine .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10759 33:19 |we did n't have to see anyone who was n't sort of this perfect image .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10760 33:32 |someone presented a bill in america| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10761 33:34 |to prevent more deaf children from being born .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10762 33:37 |and how did they present this ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10763 33:39 |they wanted to suggest that deaf people could not get married .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10764 33:45 |and luckily this did not happen .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10765 33:50 |sterilization was another idea .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10766 33:53 |long time ago they often sterilized deaf women| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10767 33:57 |so that they could n't have children .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10768 34:00 |the concern was that more deaf babies would be born ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10769 34:02 |so they would be sterilized to prevent this .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10770 34:04 |that did happen .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10771 34:08 |genetic screening .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10772 34:09 |now there 's research that you identify if there 's a disability ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10773 34:13 |if there 's deafness , if something 's going on .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10774 34:15 |you can identify all these things , there are over 400 tests| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10775 34:19 |and one is the test that causes deafness .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10776 34:22 |so they can look and see if they want to , you know ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10777 34:25 |they 're hoping to maybe eliminate genetic deafness .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10778 34:33 |and if parents want to have a baby they can go to the doctor| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10779 34:37 |and the man will give some sperm and the woman can give an egg .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10780 34:42 |the doctor can screen it .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10781 34:44 |oh no , this is a bad egg , it may involve a child that would be deaf .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10782 34:49 |and they could switch it for some good sperm or good egg| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10783 34:52 |so that they would have a child that would not be deaf .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10784 34:57 |so if parents want to think about , or if they want blue eyes| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10785 35:00 |or they want specific traits for their babies , they can do that .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10786 35:03 |they can pick a blonde haired , blue eyed child .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10787 35:07 |so i feel like this is really in sort of going back to this eugenics idea .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10788 35:14 |but if the baby that is developing is not developing normally ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10789 35:20 |the doctor can tell the parents that the baby may have| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10790 35:23 |certain health problems , including deafness .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10791 35:26 |and ask the parents what they would want to do| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10792 35:28 |and offering abortion as a choice .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10793 35:31 |and it is their legal choice .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10794 35:32 |if they choose not to carry that baby to term , they can go ahead and abort .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10795 35:37 |if they decide they do n't want to have a deaf child and start all over .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10796 35:45 |so it 's very scary to me .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10797 35:47 |i think about how people could just abort a baby just because of deafness .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10798 35:53 |and it 's , i think often because the hospital| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10799 35:55 |has no idea about deafness and having a deaf client .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10800 36:01 |and they keep that data confidential so we do n't know| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10801 36:04 |exactly how many babies have been aborted for this reason .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10802 36:07 |there 's no proof , but it is their right to abort| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10803 36:12 |if they do n't want to have that baby because of their deafness .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10804 36:16 |the next issue is cochlear implants .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10805 36:21 |you can have the baby .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10806 36:22 |if they decide to keep the baby , then the baby is born| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10807 36:25 |and find out the baby is deaf , oh .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10808 36:28 |no , it 's too late .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10809 36:30 |we now have this deaf baby .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10810 36:31 |so the idea is how can we fix this baby ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10811 36:34 |and with technology there 's now a surgery and a device called| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10812 36:40 |a cochlear implant that can be inserted into the baby .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10813 36:45 |so there are studies now that show about stem cell research .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10814 36:54 |with clones .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10815 36:56 |and they can grow another , you know , if you lose an arm for example ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10816 37:04 |and they can grow a new arm that could be used .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10817 37:06 |so there 's stem cell research going on .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10818 37:08 |so now they 're thinking how could we use this to cure deafness ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10819 37:13 |maybe we could grow a new ear or grow new parts of the ear| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10820 37:16 |and surgically replace them .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10821 37:25 |i 've a question .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10822 37:27 |in 2011 what practices do we still have ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10823 37:32 |do you think we still have all of these practices ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10824 37:36 |do we still block people from coming into the country ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10825 37:41 |what do you think ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10826 38:00 |luckily , no .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10827 38:01 |deaf people are now allowed to come into the country .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10828 38:05 |a few people may be told no , but in general this is ok .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10829 38:09 |this was an old practice that is not used very often anymore .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10830 38:14 |how about segregation ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10831 38:17 |do you think this practice is still happening ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10832 38:21 |it 's very strange because it 's sort of a yes and no .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10833 38:25 |a long time ago deaf children were sent to a deaf school .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10834 38:31 |now we have a different mindset .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10835 38:35 |deaf schools may not always the best for students .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10836 38:39 |it 's best , maybe a student wants to mainstreamed in their own town .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10837 38:49 |and often those schools were broken down| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10838 38:52 |and the students were sent to their own schools , in their own towns .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10839 38:56 |so segregation does still happen| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10840 38:57 |but now we almost feel like it 's the opposite way ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10841 39:00 |because now instead of being in a deaf community ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10842 39:02 |the deaf students are alone in their towns .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10843 39:06 |marriage restrictions no longer .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10844 39:07 |how about sterilization ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10845 39:09 |do you think this still happens ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10846 39:10 |a long time ago there were many .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10847 39:12 |today it may still happen if the parents want to do it .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10848 39:18 |if the child is still under 18 ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10849 39:20 |but a long time ago parents could still decide even after the age of 18 .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10850 39:26 |can you even imagine that ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10851 39:27 |after the age of 18 , your parents being allowed to say| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10852 39:29 |that you could be sterilized .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10853 39:31 |but no , luckily it does not happen anymore .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10854 39:35 |the rest , we do still have them today .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10855 39:38 |they are still practiced today .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10856 39:46 |the top 4 really have improved but the bottom 4 are still practiced today .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10857 39:51 |they still happen .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10858 39:54 |so my question .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10859 39:56 |the word eugenics .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10860 40:01 |many people look at that and say it 's a bad word .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10861 40:03 |oh , and we do n't practice eugenics anymore .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10862 40:05 |that does n't happen .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10863 40:07 |but when i look at this and i think we do still practice eugenics .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10864 40:14 |i would like a new word i would like to introduce .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10865 40:21 |research and the goal is to , is improvement .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10866 40:26 |it does n't mean the same as eugenics .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10867 40:34 |it has a very bad history associated with that word .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10868 40:37 |so the new word and the new practice ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10869 40:40 |it has been carried on but it is called genetics .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10870 40:46 |and many people disagree .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10871 40:49 |but in my opinion this is what it looks like .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10872 40:52 |and you know , you can interpret the information the way you see fit .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10873 41:06 |today the medical view and the community view conflict .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10874 41:16 |in the medical view , there 's many different advances being made ;| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10875 41:21 |money is being given constantly to progression in that field| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10876 41:25 |and it 's growing very quickly .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10877 41:29 |at the same time , american sign language is increasing as well .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10878 41:37 |students that have taken asl , the number has just increased very rapidly .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10879 41:42 |however these two views are at great conflict with each other .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10880 41:49 |it 's kind of ironic , students that can hear celebrate diversity| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10881 41:55 |and see all the benefits ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10882 41:57 |whereas the medical field is trying to eliminate the deaf community .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10883 42:03 |so how will it work ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10884 42:05 |where should the money go ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10885 42:13 |again , the world health organization suggests that with deaf children ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10886 42:21 |their english skills , reading and writing skills are a concern .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10887 42:28 |they are encouraging students , deaf children , to learn their native language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10888 42:34 |however in the past the emphasis was on oral , the oral approach .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10889 42:39 |so there are these conflicting approaches .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10890 42:44 |the avt , auditory verbal therapy program| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10891 42:48 |is what i 'd like to talk about right now .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10892 42:53 |over time using that oral philosophy ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10893 42:56 |where students are not encouraged to use sign language ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10894 42:59 |where they must rely on speech reading , lip reading only for communication ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10895 43:06 |that was very popular .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10896 43:08 |now people realize how little is actually understood through lip reading .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10897 43:16 |it is not the best visual approach .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10898 43:20 |avt is actually forbidding sign language and lip reading .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10899 43:25 |they force children to rely on their residual hearing| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10900 43:29 |with hearing aids , cochlear implants , etcetera .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10901 43:32 |teachers will speak but they cover their mouths as they 're speaking .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10902 43:36 |this is the approach that they are using .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10903 43:39 |they are n't allowed to use any visual cues at all ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10904 43:42 |including the lips for lip reading .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10905 43:55 |again , the irony .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10906 43:59 |more and more babies that are born hearing babies are learning sign language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10907 44:05 |they 're being taught by their parents .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10908 44:08 |once they can speak , they switch over to spoken language only .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10909 44:13 |however , a deaf child born is forbidden to use sign language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10910 44:18 |they are , you know , encouraged to use only the oral approach .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10911 44:26 |sign language was invented by deaf people .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10912 44:30 |and it 's being given to the hearing community whereas they 're not able to ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10913 44:35 |or encouraged to use it in their own lives .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10914 44:43 |now think of this .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10915 44:44 |we have laws .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10916 44:46 |for example , if a family speaks spanish , a spanish family| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10917 44:53 |and their child speaks spanish at home| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10918 44:57 |but then goes into school and learns english .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10919 45:00 |are they allowed to speak spanish when they go home ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10920 45:02 |does the law say that they can not use spanish at any time ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10921 45:06 |no , it 's their right .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10922 45:07 |the family 's right to use their first language , of course .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10923 45:11 |with deaf children , they go to school and they are not able to use the language| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10924 45:17 |that they 're using possibly you know , with the family or their native language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10925 45:21 |they 're not able or encouraged to use american sign language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10926 45:24 |it 's ironic .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10927 45:39 |in closing , i would like to compare society and the deaf community .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10928 45:44 |society today does not understand why deaf people| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10929 45:49 |want to be the way they are and not change .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10930 45:55 |hearing people say you should be upset , you should change ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10931 45:58 |you should want to hear .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10932 45:59 |you know , and deaf people are saying we are fine ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10933 46:02 |we are perfectly happy the way we are .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10934 46:04 |and this has been an ongoing struggle .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10935 46:06 |for example , i mean , it 's just simply the society does accept them as we are .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10936 46:13 |you know , however , you know , in american society| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10937 46:16 |there are many people that value diversity .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10938 46:19 |and why is it that they can not value the deaf community| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10939 46:23 |as being a diverse group ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10940 46:26 |this struggle is ongoing .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10941 46:29 |doctors progress with their field and forbid sign language ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10942 46:33 |encourage cochlear implants with the goal being to reduce the deafness .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10943 46:41 |they do not want deaf people to be deaf .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10944 46:47 |that they are subhuman , inhuman .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10945 46:52 |when a baby is born or developing , sometimes they are encouraged to be aborted .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10946 46:59 |they are not valued .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10947 47:01 |they are not encouraged to be a member of the deaf community .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10948 47:05 |they are looked down upon , oppressed .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10949 47:06 |it 's continuous .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10950 47:11 |there is a lot of oppression and i have experienced a lot of oppression .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10951 47:16 |do deaf people sit back and take it ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10952 47:18 |the deaf community is fighting back .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10953 47:27 |there is a new word in the deaf community known as audism .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10954 47:33 |i want to let you know it is not in the dictionary .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10955 47:36 |you will not find it there .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10956 47:43 |it 's the same connotation as racism , any type of oppression for deaf people .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10957 47:50 |you know , it could be seen in the same way .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10958 47:55 |what it means is that deaf people or some people are oppressed| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10959 47:59 |because of their race , their sexual agenda or something else .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10960 48:09 |there 's another word also being talked about in the deaf community ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10961 48:15 |known as liguicism , an oppression of language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10962 48:22 |this word was not developed in the deaf community but other researchers in| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10963 48:27 |other countries have developed this for their languages| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10964 48:31 |but it actually does apply to american sign language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10965 48:35 |the same concept .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10966 48:47 |in the deaf community there are deaf artists that are able to express| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10967 48:51 |the ongoing struggle that deaf people experience on a regular basis| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10968 48:56 |and this is one example .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10969 49:14 |now this is interesting .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10970 49:17 |what do you think this picture represents ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10971 49:21 |does it not look like a dog sitting at the table below , beneath a family| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10972 49:28 |where the family members or people are talking above where the person is| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10973 49:33 |unable to understand what the communication is ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10974 49:36 |their feeling of isolation in a family , that is what this represents .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10975 49:39 |and this is an ongoing struggle in the deaf community .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10976 49:46 |now what do deaf people want for the future ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10977 49:50 |what do deaf people want ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10978 50:02 |what deaf people want is exactly the same as other people .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10979 50:06 |they want their culture to be valued , they want their language to be valued ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10980 50:09 |their identity to be valued .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10981 50:11 |they want to preserve sign language and their way of being .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10982 50:19 |in the deaf community , and deaf people want to be valued .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10983 50:26 |is that all ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10984 50:27 |no .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10985 50:41 |if the deaf people were , was left alone and respected| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10986 50:49 |and with that research continue ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10987 50:56 |that would be something that the deaf community| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10988 50:59 |would prefer to not have to have that constant threat| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10989 51:02 |where the medical field is constantly threatening to| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10990 51:07 |reduce the number of people in the deaf community .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10991 51:10 |and take away their deafness .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10992 51:13 |i want to speak clearly today and say that it is ok to be deaf .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10993 51:18 |we have a very good and healthy way of being , a good life .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10994 51:23 |you know , parents can find other ways to relate to their deaf children .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10995 51:29 |if they use sign language we are , you know ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10996 51:32 |we have a beautiful language and we are ok .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10997 51:41 |now in the future you will be working with deaf children ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10998 51:45 |i 'm not sure if that 's true for everyone .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*10999 51:48 |and what parents decide for deaf children sometimes is to forbid sign language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11000 51:53 |it is a parent 's decision , you know ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11001 51:57 |however when you 're working with a deaf child| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11002 52:00 |and you 're interacting with them and you 're feeling , you know ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11003 52:04 |that their child might be upset , i mean behave being in a , you know , in a way| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11004 52:10 |that is not very helpful , they 're having a difficult time with behavior .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11005 52:16 |you must look at the purpose , the reason behind it .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11006 52:19 |it 's probably because the communication is failing .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11007 52:22 |whereas , you know , with that avt theory that we spoke about before .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11008 52:27 |often they 'll bring in behavior specialists to look at why a child might be ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11009 52:31 |you know , depressed and they might start to counsel the child| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11010 52:34 |and they might find that it 's because you know , it is a behavior problem| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11011 52:39 |versus a communication problem| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11012 52:40 |but i encourage you to think about what it is that 's really going on .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11013 52:43 |why is the child upset ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11014 52:45 |if there are communication issues , i want you to focus on a child| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11015 52:49 |possibly one on one , gesture with them 'til they have eye contact with you .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11016 52:55 |make sure that you 've got their attention| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11017 52:57 |and you 've got some form of communication with them .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11018 52:59 |if speaking does n't work , definitely try gestures until you know that| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11019 53:04 |the child understands you and i suggest that that will make a big difference .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11020 53:11 |you know , the parents , if they make a decision one way or the other ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11021 53:14 |that 's one thing ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11022 53:15 |but that 's something that i would encourage you as professionals to do .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11023 53:18 |and that is the end of my presentation .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11024 53:20 |do you have any questions ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11025 53:24 |first .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11026 53:26 |> > i kind of want your opinion on the cochlear implant .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11027 53:30 |are you against them ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11028 53:33 |for i 've seen them be very beneficial .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11029 53:44 |> > i 'm going to tell you my opinion first and then there is| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11030 53:48 |a variety of opinions in the deaf community , however , ok ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11031 53:52 |so my opinion is that many deaf people , if they 're older| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11032 53:55 |and decide to have a cochlear implant , you know ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11033 53:57 |enjoy it for the reasons like listening to music , etcetera .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11034 54:02 |but there are actually 2 points i 'd like to make .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11035 54:04 |a cochlear implant , is like something that has to be thought of| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11036 54:11 |like why are you getting one ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11037 54:12 |to develop speech ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11038 54:17 |my biggest problem with it is that it then might lead to ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11039 54:21 |you know , at some point forbidding sign language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11040 54:23 |and in that case , i would be against it , like with the avt theory .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11041 54:28 |doctors feel like once a cochlear implant is implanted ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11042 54:32 |that the child should not be allowed to use sign language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11043 54:35 |if they allow sign language , then you know , then i 'm ok with that .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11044 54:40 |but you have to think what is the cochlear implant for ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11045 54:43 |so that the child has to listen and has to hear ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11046 54:46 |you know , do they consider that the child might be perfectly ok without it ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11047 54:50 |or you really have to look at the reasons behind why it 's happening .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11048 54:54 |now if it leads to preventing sign language , then i am 100 percent against it .| 2QCyl_nQHXo

_*11050 55:05 |implant and if you had a child would you decide to not give them an implant ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11051 55:21 |> > some interesting information is this .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11052 55:23 |you know , the discussion that we 've had about the concerns with deaf people ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11053 55:28 |you know , deaf people making more deaf children , etcetera .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11054 55:31 |research has proven that 90 percent of deaf children from hearing parents ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11055 55:37 |are from hearing parents .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11056 55:39 |now deaf parents , the 10 percent , is small .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11057 55:44 |it 's just 10 percent .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11058 55:45 |whereas 90 percent of parents with deaf children are hearing , right ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11059 55:49 |so it 's kind of interesting .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11060 55:51 |10 versus 90 percent .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11061 55:54 |now i 'll focus on the 90 percent , the hearing parents right now .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11062 55:57 |many of them do want their children to have cochlear implants , that 's true .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11063 56:01 |however , their reasons vary .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11064 56:05 |some want it because they want their child to speak , for example .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11065 56:09 |now many of those hearing parents are uninformed about| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11066 56:13 |sign language and deaf culture .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11067 56:17 |when a baby is born , you know , with that medical view| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11068 56:24 |they are being advised to get cochlear implants ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11069 56:27 |to be you know , only taught the oral approach , you know ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11070 56:30 |that 's what the recommendation is .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11071 56:31 |they 're never encouraged to go and interact with deaf people| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11072 56:35 |and the deaf community .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11073 56:36 |you know , check out sign language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11074 56:38 |the parents just are ill informed .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11075 56:41 |so once that is accepted that path , they are then , you know ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11076 56:47 |they know they are forbidding their child to use sign language .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11077 56:51 |but they just do n't know the other options .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11078 56:53 |so that 's the problem with the medical view .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11079 56:56 |with deaf parents however , many of them| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11080 56:59 |choose not to have a cochlear implant for their child ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11081 57:01 |but a few deaf parents with a deaf child think well , you know , you know ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11082 57:10 |down the road maybe , you know , because the education in the deaf field| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11083 57:15 |is n't as good for example , they might encourage their child to get one .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11084 57:20 |and possibly , you know , get involved with hearing culture and deaf culture .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11085 57:25 |but deaf parents , you know , do sometimes choose that for the children .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11086 57:29 |now if i had a child that was born deaf ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11087 57:32 |i would not choose to give them a cochlear implant .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11088 57:35 |you know , i know that how to interact and have , you know , communication ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11089 57:41 |challenge them , make sure they , you know ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11090 57:44 |prepare for college , go to college , all of that so .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11091 57:48 |i think that my children will be fine .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11092 57:52 |any other questions ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11093 57:55 |i can accept any kind of question .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11094 57:56 |no question is stupid , you do n't have to be embarrassed .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11095 57:58 |honestly , ask me anything .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11096 58:00 |> > just one more question ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11097 58:02 |we 'll probably call it a day and turn it back to tiffany .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11098 58:08 |in terms of two adults who are both deaf and want to have a child| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11099 58:15 |and the child , in terms of their thinking ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11100 58:18 |would they feel better having a child who is deaf ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11101 58:25 |as opposed to a child who is hearing ?| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11102 58:27 |in other words , their wish is for a child who 's deaf .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11103 58:33 |if they 're members of the deaf culture .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11104 58:41 |> > here 's a fact .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11105 58:44 |many deaf people want deaf children .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11106 58:47 |this is true .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11107 58:50 |it 's almost like moms wanting a daughter or a dad wanting a son .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11108 58:57 |you know , that kind of wish .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11109 59:01 |you know , because many people want to have that common bond with their child .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11110 59:05 |you know , dads want football for their kids ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11111 59:08 |want to engage in the same kinds of activities .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11112 59:12 |it 's very similar to the feeling in the deaf community .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11113 59:16 |when a deaf parent is born and the child is deaf , they are often elated ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11114 59:21 |they know that there will be no communication barriers ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11115 59:23 |we can teach the family values , you know ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11116 59:25 |there will be very little frustration| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11117 59:27 |or if the child does experience frustration ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11118 59:29 |they know those experiences and can support them .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11119 59:32 |and you know , they can encourage their deaf , their pride in the deaf community .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11120 59:38 |and they will send them to school , you know , to the best possible programs .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11121 59:41 |there are some deaf parents that are , you| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11122 59:45 |know , excited to have hearing children , too .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11123 59:47 |obviously they will be excited to have a child hearing or deaf ,| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11124 59:52 |but those are the observations i 've had .| 2QCyl_nQHXo
_*11125 59:55 |> > thank you .| 2QCyl_nQHXo

_*11175 3:53 |the no| cN8aVgIttRk
_*11176 0:23 |our doctors are people we trust in . when they tell us something our first instinct is to| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11177 0:28 |believe them . however , for many deaf children this can be what leads their parents astray .| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11178 0:37 |there are three myths almost all doctors will tell their patient when it comes to deafness .| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11179 0:43 |1 . using asl will damage the auditory tissue in your brain .| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11180 0:49 |tawny holmes works for the national association of the deaf .| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11181 0:57 |tawny : `` hey everyone , good morning ! ''| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11182 0:59 |she says that most people think audio and visual languages are processed in different parts of| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11183 1:06 |the brain , however research says otherwise .| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11184 1:10 |tawny : `` that means that one part of your brain is used to understand language and that portion| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11185 1:19 |given language . ''| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11186 1:28 |ability to learn to speak .| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11187 1:31 |beth benedict works at gallaudet university and says that asl does not hurt your ability to learn speech .| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11188 1:39 |beth : `` in fact , research has shown that signing helps with speech development . ''| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11189 1:49 |did n't sign . do you know which group had the most proficiency when it came to speaking ?| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11190 1:54 |the group that signed . ''| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11191 1:55 |beth : `` it was not just speaking , but the kids are also reading and writing better than them . ''| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11192 1:59 |and that decision to wait to give children language while they learn to hear| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11193 2:03 |with their cochlear implants can be detrimental to their development .| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11194 2:08 |tawny : `` just wait to teach the child ? no ! teach them sign , add in speaking| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11195 2:14 |beth : `` you need language and then you can learn to speak . ''| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11196 2:32 |graduate from high school reading at a 4th grade level .| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11197 2:42 |maybe some are from 3rd or 4th grade , but really it all ranges , all the way up to college . ''| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11198 2:48 |this statistic was based off of a study done in 2000 on high school student 's sat scores .| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11199 2:56 |tawny : `` first look at whether the sat is a good form of measurement . it would appear| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11200 3:00 |not as less schools are using it . secondly , with the 2000 study remember that most of| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11201 3:11 |being scanned at birth . the average age of detection was two and a half to three years old .| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11202 3:28 |are identified at birth . ''| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11203 3:30 |beth : `` really there 's many factors . it 's because people keep telling kids that ,| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11204 3:37 |but even after a multitude of studies have proven these myths wrong ,| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11205 3:43 |beth : `` we 're still seeing doctors and audiologists , and medical professionals telling families not to sign .| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11206 3:50 |many students tell me how they were raised only speaking because their parents| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11207 3:54 |had no idea asl was an option . ''| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11208 3:56 |gallaudet university houses a renowned research facility that 's working to disprove these myths| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11209 4:03 |and the nad is working to spread that message .| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11210 4:08 |tawny : `` i am going to get in touch with the education advocates . ''| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11211 4:16 |tawny : `` when it comes to deaf education or early intervention they are ready to serve| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11212 4:20 |the community and work with them , together . ''| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11213 4:22 |both women agreed that the decision to not use american sign language is due to myths like these .| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11214 4:30 |there are teams at the nad and gallaudet university working to advocate and research how these myths are| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11215 4:37 |actually false . this is the final story in our language equality series . the goal : to show parents| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11216 4:52 |these stories and more on our website .| RHoIRuo0ng4
_*11217 0:00 |hey guys ! so new video , a little bit shorter , nothing big , just kind of like an update thing .| 3NlbDxpqFls

_*11484 2:31 |we had just met , yet we talked for hours and hours .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11485 2:36 |we completely forgot about time and the world around us .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11486 2:41 |she enchanted me with her intelligence , her laughter , her love of live .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11487 2:49 |it was all quite simply magical .| QZCjFo7Kb4E

_*11489 3:17 |i think that , for the very first time , i 'm really in love .| QZCjFo7Kb4E

_*11492 3:34 |she 's a hard-working student . i 'm proud of her .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11493 3:38 |she knows now that that i took out a small loan and set up a business growing vegetables .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11494 3:42 |that allowed me to create jobs for my brothers .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11495 3:45 |i told her some of my secrets . i kept one for myself .| QZCjFo7Kb4E

_*11497 4:03 |he says he 'd like to talk to me about something , so i want to look my very finest .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11498 4:09 |maybe he 's going to propose to me - it 's ok to dream , is n't it ?| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11499 4:16 |we 've been together for a good while now , and we 've never even talked about making love .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11500 4:23 |it seems strange that he does n't want to speak to me about it .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11501 4:27 |sometimes , i drop little hints in that direction , but he pretends not to understand .| QZCjFo7Kb4E

_*11503 4:39 |this evening is critical . i have to tell her everything .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11504 4:44 |i 'm afraid that she might hear about it from someone else , and that she 'd be upset .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11505 4:52 |it 's still hard for me to believe .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11506 4:54 |because of 15 minutes of pleasure without a condom ,| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11507 4:58 |because i was so damned stupid and was n't able to keep my own desire under control ,| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11508 5:03 |i 'm hiv-positive .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11509 5:06 |aminata , i hope that you 'll forgive me for having told you so late .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11510 5:13 |yes , i was selfish . i did n't reveal my secret to you because| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11511 5:18 |i wanted your smiles , your touch , your kisses - without judgment , and without pity .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11512 5:27 |i 'm causing you to suffer . i 'm so sorry to hurt you so .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11513 5:33 |you 're going away , and i 'm losing you .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11514 5:50 |victor is hiv-positive ! and he waits until now to tell me about it !| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11515 5:55 |what an idiot ! i hate him !| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11516 6:03 |i do n't know what i feel for him any more - anger , fear , pity ... or tenderness ?| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11517 6:12 |but , after all , he 's still the same guy i fell in love with .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11518 6:16 |the same guy who made me laugh , who made me dream .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11519 6:21 |and our future ? well , some things will surely have to change| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11520 6:26 |but the heart of the matter is that i still love him .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11521 6:31 |i hope that he 'll forgive me for having been distant with him .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11522 6:35 |i needed time to come to terms with the news .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11523 6:38 |from this moment on , there is no good reason why we should n't see each other .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11524 7:15 |i dream of growing old . it 's something i never thought of before .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11525 7:20 |i look forward to having gray hair , and wrinkles .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11526 7:24 |i dream of living happily , for a long , long time ... with her .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11527 7:30 |we 've gone through some tough times , but now , everything has fallen into place .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11528 7:36 |my life has changed . i love life now . i concentrate on the heart of the matter .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11529 7:55 |seeing victor so confident and happy gives me a lot of courage and hope .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11530 8:00 |every day that i spend with him , i realize just how lucky i am .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11531 8:05 |i admire him . he 's a great man . he 's my man .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11532 8:10 |i would n't change a moment of our story .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11533 8:14 |by the way , our story has only just begun .| QZCjFo7Kb4E
_*11534 0:00 |hello everyone .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11535 0:02 |now i 'm going to talk about ...| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11536 0:05 |myself : p| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11537 0:07 |and my career plans .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11538 0:12 |first off , i 'm in my junior year of college .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11539 0:19 |it 's half over , almost the last exam ! i 'm nervous !| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11540 0:27 |but i 'll be fine ... anyway so ...| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11541 0:31 |i should back up a bit .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11542 0:38 |when i was around age 8 ,| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11543 0:45 |i decided i wanted to become a veterinarian .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11544 0:52 |i wanted to be that for a long time .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11545 0:58 |i think- oh , i job a job at an animal hospital my senior year of high school .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11546 1:10 |so for ten years , i wanted to be a vet .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11547 1:15 |i wanted to go to cornell vet school .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11548 1:24 |now i go to stony brook university on long island .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11549 1:35 |when i entered college , i still wanted to become a veterinarian .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11550 1:42 |but then , after thinking about it more , i realized how expensive vet school was| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11551 1:54 |and so maybe vet school was n't the right decision .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11552 1:57 |i 'm majoring in marine vertebrate biology .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11553 2:05 |then , i thought that maybe marine biology would be a good career path for me instead of becoming a veterinarian .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11554 2:16 |i started looking at other career options online| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11555 2:26 |i found something interesting on the nasa webpage| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11556 2:36 |called astrobiology .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11557 2:43 |what does that mean ?| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11558 2:47 |why would it be connected to marine biology ? ? i 'll explain !| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11559 2:51 |oh , sorry , my hair 's all messed up ... i did n't shower ...| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11560 3:22 |ok , good enough ...| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11561 3:29 |so , now back to talking about my major and how it 's connected to astronomy and astrobiology .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11562 3:39 |so , first , stars and our earth have different environments .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11563 3:52 |stars and other planets tend to be freezing or have low pressure compared to earth .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11564 4:09 |because those environments are not like earth , they 're called `` extreme environments . ''| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11565 4:29 |examples of extreme environments on other planets include really high or temperatures and really high or low pressure .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11566 4:56 |do we have any extreme environments on earth ? yes !| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11567 5:04 |earth has a lot of them !| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11568 5:06 |one example is antarctica and the ocean surrounding it .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11569 5:19 |antarctic waters are obviously really really cold .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11570 5:31 |another example is volcanoes and microorganisms ( fs organisms ) .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11571 5:45 |i think this is the sign for organism ? ? ( signs )| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11572 5:48 |that 's the problem - there are no signs for scientific words ! ! ! !| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11573 5:54 |you have to spell all the science words letter by letter ! ! ! !| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11574 5:58 |anyway , so , the examples are antarctica , volcanoes ... and do you know something called a hydrothermal vent ?| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11575 6:17 |hydrothermal vents are basically like volcanoes , but on the ocean floor .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11576 6:26 |i think it 's cool . lots of living things live near , on , or even in hydrothermal vents ! they 're mostly microorganisms .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11577 6:59 |yeah , so the three examples of extreme environments on earth are antarctica , volcanoes , and hydrothermal vents .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11578 7:18 |so we can take what we learn from extreme environments on earth and apply our knowledge to other planets .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11579 7:25 |sounds cool , right ?| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11580 7:29 |i would like to study these extreme environments on earth .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11581 7:39 |it 'd be nice to apply my findings from extreme environments on earth to other planets or stars .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11582 7:54 |i could see if living things here on earth can adapt to the extreme environments on other planets . that would be cool .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11583 8:05 |i like astrobiology . it 's interesting .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11584 8:09 |for grad school , i have three dream schools .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11585 8:19 |my first choice is the university of washington in seattle .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11586 8:31 |that 's my first choice !| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11587 8:35 |it has an amazing astrobiology program that i 'm interested in . i really want to go ! i 'd love it !| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11588 8:45 |my second choice is an oceanography school called woods hole . it 's in boston .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11589 9:01 |it 's connected to mit . yeah , i know ! fancy !| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11590 9:12 |i think i have a good chance ... i 'll explain later ...| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11591 9:18 |the third choice is another wonderful oceanography program called scripps . it 's in san diego , california . i think this is the sign for san diego ? ?| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11592 9:47 |yeah , so university of washington , woods hole , and san diego are my top three choices for grad school .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11593 10:15 |but my dream is to go to university of washington .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11594 10:18 |i think i have a good chance of getting into university of washington ... hope so !| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11595 10:23 |you know ... woods hole and scripps are pretty hard to get into ...| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11596 10:31 |but they 're awesome programs .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11597 10:36 |if i went to school in san diego , i would love it .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11598 10:38 |my sister goes to college in rochester , rit .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11599 10:46 |i think it 's freezing there now .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11600 10:49 |on the other hand , san diego is so warm , sunny , and beautiful all year 'round .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11601 10:59 |and grad school is for 6 years !| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11602 11:03 |the weather at the university of washington is not as awesome as it is in san diego ... so maybe i 'll say san diego is my second choice now and woods hole is my third .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11603 11:21 |i was also thinking about going to the university of colorado for oceanography .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11604 11:32 |it also has an astrobiology program .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11605 11:37 |but , is n't it weird that colorado would have an oceanography program when it 's not even close to the ocean ? ? ? ?| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11606 11:47 |it 's like if kansas had an oceanography program ! ! it would just be so weird ! !| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11607 12:00 |you would n't expect that !| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11608 12:04 |but yeah , i really want to go into astrobiology .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11609 12:13 |but , my goal would be to get a phd in oceanography with a specialty in astrobiology| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11610 12:22 |yeah . i think it 'd be cool .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11611 12:27 |oh , and i 'm also working as an undergraduate research assistant in a marine biology lab .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11612 12:42 |i like it .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11613 12:45 |i 'm just doing basic things in the lab . have n't been working there for very long .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11614 12:53 |only for a few months .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11615 12:56 |but , soon , i 'll be doing important stuff . like dna analysis . looking forward to that .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11616 13:11 |yeah . i think that would be cool .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11617 13:15 |i like imagining the future where i 'm working and doing important things .| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11618 13:22 |yeah . oh , wow , this vlog is 13 minutes long ! time to wrap it up !| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11619 13:29 |thanks for watching ! !| nqrgn9DHTmk
_*11620 0:01 think 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11621 0:11 |track i 'm pat and i worked for the irs| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11622 0:14 |if you qualify for| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11623 0:18 |innocent spouse relief regardless of whether you are male| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11624 0:23 |or female the irs| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11625 0:26 |has made an important change that could help you from now on| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11626 0:33 |the two-year time limit no longer applies to a particular type| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11627 0:38 |a request for innocent spouse relief this is the type of request| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11628 0:45 |seeking what is known as equitable relief the kind of relief| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11629 0:49 |that is often considered when people are faced with difficult| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11630 0:53 |or intimidating situations for example| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11631 0:57 |this may apply to victims have domestic abuse| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11632 1:00 |if you qualify for equitable relief| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11633 1:05 |you no longer have a two-year deadline to make that request| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11634 1:09 |in addition to future requests| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11635 1:13 |this change applies to requests that we are currently considering| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11636 1:17 |and if you 've been previously denied relief based solely on the two-year time| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11637 1:26 limit 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11638 1:26 |you can reapply for relief using form| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11639 1:30 |8857 which is the request| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11640 1:33 |for innocent spouse relief but if your case is currently suspended| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11641 1:40 |you do n't have to reapply because we will automatically| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11642 1:44 |take another look at your case now here 's a word of caution| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11643 1:50 |you should also know that the two-year time limit| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11644 1:54 |continues to apply to other types requests| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11645 1:58 |for innocent spouse relief| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11646 2:02 |and that other restrictions and time limits| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11647 2:04 |set by law apply to any requests| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11648 2:08 |for innocent spouse relief| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11649 2:13 |to find out more about innocent spouse relief| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11650 2:15 |go to www that irs| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11651 2:19 |dakka the move| 0h4cK1HfYSc
_*11652 0:47 |all infants come into this world ready to be loved and ready to learn .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11653 0:51 |what is the key for acquiring language ,| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11654 0:54 |particularly for a deaf or hard of hearing baby ?| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11655 0:57 |as parents of a newborn , the love you share with your child is natural and instinctive .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11656 1:01 |this is your bond .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11657 1:03 |this bond inspires an innate desire for communication .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11658 1:08 |your baby will learn about the world through familiar smells , the sense of taste ,| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11659 1:12 |the warm touch of your skin , and most of all , through the eyes .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11660 1:16 |for your child , world experiences and language| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11661 1:20 |will come most naturally and easily through the eyes .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11662 1:24 |the eyes are your child 's single biggest strength .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11663 1:30 |i just wanted to say that it 's a journey as a parent . that you start off with the very simple ...| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11664 1:36 |you know , you want to know the eat , drink , mama , dada , because those are the important things .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11665 1:42 |and as your child grows , your signing kind of grows with them ... kind of blossoms because you want to keep up with them .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11666 1:50 |and so , my son , who is now in first grade ... is becoming , now , a kind of teacher to us .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11667 1:54 |it 's a journey and it can be rough at times but when you communicate , it 's just the most awesome feeling .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11668 2:06 |sign languages are complete and natural languages .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11669 2:09 |just like any language , american sign language| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11670 2:13 |is acquired through meaningful exposure and interaction .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11671 2:17 |today , asl is the fourth most widely used language in the united states .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11672 2:21 |it is taught in high schools and universities for credit .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11673 2:25 |babies acquire language along a developmental continuum .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11674 2:29 |asl builds on the earliest connections you have with your child , allowing your deaf or hard of hearing child| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11675 2:34 |the opportunity to process and understand| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11676 2:39 |the meaningful family interactions directed at him or her .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11677 2:43 |babies exposed to and interacting with american sign language will typically produce| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11678 2:47 |their first words around seven to eight months of age .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11679 2:53 |american sign language has been a gift to me and a gift to the children that i work with .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11680 2:59 |an amazing resource , an amazing key to open up their minds and their ideas .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11681 3:03 |i 've worked with high school students , all the way down to infants .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11682 3:07 |because it 's so critical for children to have the relationship to their parents , to have the attachment to their parents ...| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11683 3:13 |and to have the love and caring that their parents can give them ,| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11684 3:16 |and communication is the key to that . so here is this beautiful gift for families to use .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11685 3:23 |really , my job is being a parent . and my priority is to communicate with my daughter .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11686 3:28 |and i figured my job as a parent is to open doors ,| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11687 3:32 |and asl was a door that i opened .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11688 3:36 |along with speech therapy , and hearing aids , and everything else .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11689 3:41 |and i have a daughter that can walk around through many different doors and feel very comfortable .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11690 3:46 |it 's been a blessing , and it 's one of the best decisions i 've ever made .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11691 3:51 |early acquisition of a language provides the foundation for cognitive growth ,| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11692 3:54 |the thinking and learning skills that children need throughout their lives .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11693 3:58 |through cognition , children are able to engage in more complex actions and think more abstractly .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11694 4:04 |early language is a critical aspect of this process .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11695 4:07 |babies and toddlers will use asl to communicate| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11696 4:11 |their needs and their wants , spontaneously , without effort .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11697 4:15 |age appropriate language and concept development leads to| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11698 4:19 |higher level thinking and abstract concepts .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11699 4:24 |a baby 's brain is a powerful organ .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11700 4:28 |it 's designed for learning language .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11701 4:32 |for deaf babies , it 's important that language is clear , accessible , transmitted in a positive setting , and interactive .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11702 4:37 |access to learning has to be visual , through american sign language .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11703 4:42 |children rely on their eyes and what they see in order to learn .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11704 4:46 |the children who have full access are happy , ready to learn , motivated .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11705 4:52 |they can express their thoughts and feelings . they feel safe .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11706 5:00 |i teach toddlers and babies , and at such an early age they must feel safe in expressing what they want or need to their parents .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11707 5:07 |when the parents can respond and explain the answer to them , they feel satisfied and safe .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11708 5:12 |they know that for the rest of their life , they will be secure .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11709 5:18 |rich language , expansive and flexible communication empowers both parents and children .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11710 5:24 |when language is shared and communication is easy ,| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11711 5:26 |confusion and frustration can be minimized .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11712 5:30 |oh my goodness . the brain just opens up . the flexibility of the brain , the plasticity ,| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11713 5:35 |the ability to acquire and use different resources of the brain .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11714 5:39 |that 's what those children have : they have a language resource , rich resources| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11715 5:44 |that they can use to move on to the other language .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11716 5:46 |all children are capable of learning several languages . there is no need to limit them to just one .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11717 5:51 |it 's not harmful . the process is beneficial because it helps develop the building blocks of language .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11718 5:55 |it allows the child to be flexible and interactive .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11719 5:59 |[ in spanish ] it 's very important for me because i have to be able to talk to [ my sons ] man-to-man .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11720 6:09 |you probably know families who use sign language with their very young hearing infants| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11721 6:13 |to communicate and foster spoken language development .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11722 6:17 |early sign language supports the development of critical linguistic foundations| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11723 6:21 |that are necessary for later complex thinking skills .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11724 6:28 |alex is now two , and he signs more and more everyday .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11725 6:31 |and it 's been wonderful to watch him grow and learn new signs .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11726 6:37 |he ... uh ... i wish i would have started signing with him earlier .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11727 6:41 |hearing children do with their hands , well , children play with their hands and look at them .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11728 6:45 |but the deaf baby ... we 've been looking at them and studying them .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11729 6:48 |the movements are different . they 're picking up the subtleties of language .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11730 6:52 |they 're trying to talk , they 're trying to communicate with their beautiful , beautiful hands and they do .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11731 6:57 |the shapes become more refined , and they turn and mold it into beautiful communication :| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11732 7:02 |words , ideas , and thoughts . that 's what babies need .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11733 7:07 |families and their new baby can learn american sign language , now and together .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11734 7:12 |self-esteem and identity come from positive shared experiences within the family .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11735 7:18 |as the family learns together , they can also| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11736 7:21 |meet other parents with deaf and hard of hearing children| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11737 7:25 |and discover the diverse people that make up the vibrant deaf community .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11738 7:31 |i do ... i remember when she was real young . we would go to deaf coffee night and come home .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11739 7:37 |and i would watch her as a three-year old , sleeping , moving her fingers in her sleep .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11740 7:42 |and it was just so beautiful .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11741 7:44 |now she 's ten . we come , and the code switching is automatic .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11742 7:48 |she can be with hearing kids and she 'll use her voice .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11743 7:51 |and she will be with the deaf community , and voice off ... and be fluent in both .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11744 8:00 |research shows that the family is the single most| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11745 8:04 |important factor in a child 's academic and social growth .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11746 8:08 |the family plays a critical role in establishing foundations for learning .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11747 8:11 |that means playing games , reading books daily ,| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11748 8:15 |being involved with other families and pre-schoolers ,| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11749 8:19 |knowing teachers , and helping with homework .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11750 8:22 |mealtime , for example , is an opportunity to discuss daily and current events .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11751 8:27 |with asl , you will be able to introduce new places , ideas , and vocabulary to your child .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11752 8:35 |growing up as a deaf person ,| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11753 8:40 |i often felt my parents did n't know me .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11754 8:45 |when my daughter was born , she was also deaf .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11755 8:49 |i wanted to make sure we had a relationship :| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11756 8:53 |that i knew her , and that she knew me .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11757 8:57 |i knew the key was language .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11758 9:01 |the first language she learned was sign language .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11759 9:05 |and through asl , now i feel i know my daughter .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11760 9:11 |i ca n't imagine what it would be like to live with someone and| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11761 9:18 |never speak the same language that they spoke .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11762 9:26 |i saw her go into this huge world that i had n't known| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11763 9:33 |and i saw her go comfortably . and welcomed well .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11764 9:39 |and after that , each step she was ready to take , it was easier to let her go .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11765 9:51 |start today .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11766 9:55 |communicate with your child .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11767 9:59 |show the cup , say `` cup '' , sign `` cup '' .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11768 10:06 |point to things , then get a book and learn a few signs . go to a class .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11769 10:15 |she told me why she wanted to learn sign language . but my observation is that she loved me so much .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11770 10:22 |she wanted to have a relationship with me , like any other parent wants a relationship with their child .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11771 10:27 |my mother wanted the same thing . i believe it was love .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11772 10:34 |you 're right .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11773 10:43 |the capacity for language is in all of us .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11774 10:47 |it is an essential part of the human experience .| FV69iJuXwP4
_*11775 10:50 |natural early language development through american sign language is the key to your child 's future .| FV69iJuXwP4

_*12152 0:08 |in the name of the father , the son , and the holy spirit . amen .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12153 0:13 |the creed says of god that he is the maker of heaven and earth ,| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12154 0:19 |of things visible and invisible .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12155 0:23 |in other words , there is nothing that is not made by god .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12156 0:29 |and although the word `` creation '' is not used in the creed ,| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12157 0:34 |the idea of creation is implied in that phrase .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12158 0:43 |god is creator because he not only gives to things their shape ,| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12159 0:48 |but brings into existence the very stuff out of which these things are made .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12160 0:54 |inasmuch as men are created in the image of god ,| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12161 1:01 |they are creators too , but in a limited sense .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12162 1:05 |rather we say that men such as artists , poets , musicians , inventors , etc . are creative .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12163 1:18 |we do n't speak of them as creators .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12164 1:24 |in men creativity takes the form of foreseeing or imagining new things .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12165 1:30 |we visualize in our minds , or in our imagination ,| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12166 1:34 |something that up to that time had no existence and then set about bringing into existence .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12167 1:39 |for example , an inventor sees in his mind the general outlines of a particular wagon| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12168 1:48 |its can move without horses in a moment of inspiration ;| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12169 1:52 |then he takes a piece of metal and wood and gives it the imagined form .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12170 1:56 |the imagined forms become a car !| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12171 2:02 |to say that god is the maker of heaven and earth ,| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12172 2:07 |of things visible and invisible is another way of saying that he is all in all ;| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12173 2:15 |that he is the `` alpha and the omega '' or the a and the z .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12174 2:26 |the following four issues usually come up in connection| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12175 2:30 |with the creation of the cosmos or orderly universe .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12176 2:46 |1 . the only possible answer to the first question| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12177 2:50 |is the one given by the inspired author of the book of genesis .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12178 2:54 |god created the world `` in the beginning . ''| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12179 3:02 |time is something of this world .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12180 3:06 |in other words , we can not think of time without thinking of the world .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12181 3:13 |time ( whatever it may mean ) is itself created by god along with the world .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12182 3:27 |god himself does n't have his life in time but eternity .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12183 3:35 |therefore we can not place the creation of the world in time ,| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12184 3:45 |as we can not put an unbendable sheet of metal in an envelope| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12185 3:51 |if the sheet of metal and the envelope have exactly the same .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12186 4:00 |in no case can we use the phrase `` before the creation of the world '' meaningfully ,| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12187 4:07 |because the word `` before '' has to do with time and time and the world begin and end together .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12188 4:21 |in connection with the act of creation of the world , there can not be any `` before '' .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12189 4:33 |2 . as to the question , how many years have elapsed since of the creation of the world ?| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12190 4:39 |it 's up to science to find the answer , if it can .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12191 4:44 |from the religious point of view it hardly makes any difference whether| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12192 4:48 |the earth has gone around the sun sixteen thousand| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12193 4:53 |or sixteen million times ever since its formation .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12194 5:00 |the important fact is that without god 's command the world would n't be .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12195 5:09 |the world depends on nothing for its existence save god 's will .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12196 5:20 |further , the statement `` god created the world '' is exact to a certain extent only .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12197 5:27 |in order to complete our meaning we should say : `` god creates the world . ''| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12198 5:36 |the creation of the world is never complete as long as it 's in existence .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12199 5:46 |3 . as to our third question , did or does god need the world ?| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12200 5:53 |the answer depends on the meaning of the word `` need '' .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12201 5:59 |certainly , god did n't need the world as something that would complete his being .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12202 6:06 |we may say , in more simple language , that god could do without the world ,| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12203 6:16 |but he created it out of love . the world is the work of god 's ever-productive love .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12204 6:26 |4 . the fourth question asked at the beginning of this talk is baffling only for those who misunderstand the issue involved .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12205 6:39 |the issue is `` evolutionism . ''| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12206 6:47 |evolutionary theories have been advanced by philosophers since ancient times .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12207 6:58 |an impressive -- but not quite conclusive -- account of data collected by darwin| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12208 7:07 |gave this theory a scientific basis in the middle of the 19th century , and the problem has received , since , particular attention .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12209 7:16 |enough evidence was thus accumulated then , to make almost convincing what had been thought of as plausible before .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12210 7:26 |the gist of the argument is that many thousands of years ago| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12211 7:32 |there were not as many species as there are now| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12212 7:38 |and that what we may call the higher animals ( according to scientists , man )| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12213 7:44 |developed from the lower ones .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12214 7:50 |this development is due to `` natural causes '' ,| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12215 7:54 |and it takes place according to a principle that has been worded as `` the survival of the fittest in the struggle for existence . ''| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12216 8:00 |the biblical account of creation is different .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12217 8:08 |according to it , god created each species as such , from the beginning .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12218 8:16 |in view of what is observed within the limits of known history and further ,| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12219 8:24 |in view of the present variety of living things , the biblical account is required by common sense .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12220 8:38 |even if the evolutionary view were entirely correct , we should bear in mind| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12221 8:47 |that the man who wrote the book of genesis was not a scientist .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12222 8:56 |he was a prophet who had a message to give :| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12223 9:00 |namely , that god created the conditions for the existence of man| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12224 9:08 |and that god gave man his soul in the proper moment .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12225 9:16 |to put this message across , the writer of the book of genesis used much science as he knew .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12226 9:28 |today scientists know more science| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12227 9:36 |but this `` more '' does n't invalidate the prophet 's message and insight .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12228 9:44 |evolution or no evolution , the world is the work of god .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12229 9:57 |a difficult problem that arises in connection| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12230 10:00 |with the doctrine of creation is the manner in which the world is related to god .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12231 10:11 |when the thinkers of the early church dealt with this problem ,| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12232 10:23 |there were one hebrew and two greeks ways of looking at it .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12233 10:36 |the christians could n't maintain with the greek epicureans| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12234 10:44 |that there was an absolute separation between god and the world ,| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12235 10:54 |as there is between an inventor and a car that he made .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12236 11:07 |if that were the case , the christians would have to admit that god is limited .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12237 11:21 |indeed a car that stands entirely outside the inventor `` limits '' the sculptor .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12238 11:32 |in order to understand this , it 's enough to imagine that the inventor may want to stand where the car is , without removing the car .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12239 11:49 |obviously the inventor can not do that ;| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12240 11:54 |if there is something that he is not or can not do then he is limited .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12241 12:04 |thus the christians could n't subscribe to the theory that there is an absolute separation between god and the world .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12242 12:19 |nor could they agree with the greek stoics| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12243 12:26 |for whom god was part of the world as roughly , water is part of a wet piece of sponge .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12244 12:39 |as against these two greek schools of thought ,| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12245 12:45 |the christian fathers maintained with the prophets of the old testament| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12246 12:56 |that god is prior to and is exalted above , the world ;| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12247 13:05 |they maintained that god is other than the world , and the world is other than god| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12248 13:14 |but god may said to `` contain '' or `` pervade '' the world ,| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12249 13:20 |without the world 's containing or pervading god .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12250 13:25 |this is what is meant when we say of god that he is transcendent .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12251 13:39 |god is also immanent inasmuch as he is present in the world .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12252 13:53 |we , human beings , have in god the source of our being with| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12253 14:04 |all people , animals ,| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12254 14:08 |plants and things we love and enjoy .| VJYMIfWEPDY
_*12255 14:18 |in the back of minds must be the desire of causing us to praise god for these blessings !| VJYMIfWEPDY

_*12315 0:01 |[ captioning provided by acs captions ]| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12316 0:11 |hello , everyone . my name is keith nolan .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12317 0:18 |my talk today is on the topic of the military .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12318 0:26 |i see a number of you nodding . i 'm the same way .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12319 0:35 |also , various family members such as my grandfather and great uncles fought in world war ii .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12320 0:40 |and like them , i wanted the same thing , to serve my country .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12321 0:42 |( applause )| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12322 0:43 |so , can i ?| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12323 0:49 |why ?| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12324 0:53 |regardless , i still had that longing to join the military .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12325 0:59 |for example , after i graduated from high school , three months before 9/11 occurred ,| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12326 1:04 |i went to a naval recruiting center with high hopes of joining the navy .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12327 1:09 |i went in and a strapping naval man stood up and addressed me .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12328 1:21 |he tore off a little piece of paper and wrote down three words :| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12329 1:34 |i tried various locations , a number of different times , but over and over again i got the same response .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12330 1:42 |so , i shifted gears and decided to become a teacher .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12331 1:44 |i got a masters degree in deaf education .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12332 1:47 |i taught for almost two years .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12333 1:50 |then three things occurred last spring .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12334 1:53 |the first of which , was while i was teaching a high school history class .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12335 1:59 |the bell had rung , and i sat at my desk .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12336 2:10 |then i caught myself .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12337 2:14 |and now i was perpetuating that same message to the next generation , to my own student .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12338 2:18 |that realization had a large impact that really resonated with me .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12339 2:21 |now the second thing that happened -- my friend had just moved to israel .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12340 2:26 |did you know that in israel they accept deaf people into the military ?| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12341 2:29 |could this be true ? how can deaf people be in the military , right ?| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12342 2:32 |come on !| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12343 2:35 |so , i went to israel last summer to see for myself .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12344 2:37 |i interviewed 10 deaf israeli soldiers .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12345 2:45 |third , csun here , my alma mater ,| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12346 2:49 |had recently started up an army rotc program .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12347 2:53 |rotc stands for reserve officer training corps .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12348 2:58 |students working on their college majors can concurrently participate in the rotc program .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12349 3:05 |upon graduation rotc students have a military career ready and waiting for them .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12350 3:07 |so , if one joined the army , one could commission as a second lieutenant .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12351 3:12 |that 's generally the rotc program here at csun .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12352 3:15 |i already had a profession as a teacher .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12353 3:18 |but i went ahead anyway and sent off an e-mail to the program .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12354 3:20 |i explained that i was a teacher of the deaf .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12355 3:23 |i was wondering if i could take a few classes with them so ...| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12356 3:25 |i could perhaps share their lessons with my students .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12357 3:30 |i got an e-mail response back .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12358 3:36 |it said , well , that 's interesting .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12359 3:39 |i think maybe we can work something out and you can take a few classes with us .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12360 3:43 |this was unprecedented .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12361 3:47 |although i was teaching , i decided i had to grab the opportunity right away and get my foot in the door .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12362 4:04 |it 's 98 pages of research .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12363 4:14 |during the texas war of independence ...| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12364 4:16 |there was a key character , named deaf smith .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12365 4:19 |he made a large contribution to texas winning its independence .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12366 4:23 |in the american civil war , gallaudet university has archived a list of deaf americans ...| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12367 4:26 |who fought for both the north and the south , showing that they even fought against each other .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12368 4:32 |during wwii , there are a few , rare examples as well .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12369 4:37 |some deaf people made it into the military at that time and served their country .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12370 4:40 |the point is ... america has had deaf soldiers serve in the past .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12371 4:44 |in my paper , i also discuss the deaf israeli soldiers .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12372 4:50 |i learned that they serve in non-combat roles .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12373 4:51 |they are not on the front lines engaging in fire , but rather are behind the lines serving in supportive roles .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12374 4:56 |there are a plethora of various non-combat jobs accessible to the deaf :| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12375 4:59 |intelligence , computer technology ,| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12376 5:01 |map drawing , supply , military dog training ,| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12377 5:05 |the list goes on .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12378 5:08 |so how do deaf israeli soldiers communicate with the other soldiers ?| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12379 5:12 |they told me it 's the same approach deaf people use with the hearing public on a daily basis .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12380 5:15 |you can use your voice , lip-read , gesture .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12381 5:18 |sometimes another soldier knows sign language and that can be utilized .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12382 5:20 |pen and paper , texts , computers , e-mails .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12383 5:21 |texts , computers , e-mails .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12384 5:28 |interpreters are used primarily for boot camp and miscellaneous training .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12385 5:38 |the israeli army is comprised of small groups .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12386 5:41 |each of these units with deaf soldiers have developed their own way of communicating with each other .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12387 5:48 |the top picture is of one deaf soldier i met .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12388 5:50 |the bottom photo is of him with prime minister begin in israel .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12389 5:56 |another part of my paper touches on disabled soldiers in the u.s. military .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12390 6:01 |obviously , military work can be dangerous and involve injury .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12391 6:05 |one example here is captain luckett .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12392 6:07 |due to an explosion , he lost his leg .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12393 6:23 |there are 40 other soldiers like him .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12394 6:25 |amputees who are serving in combat zones .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12395 6:27 |incredible .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12396 6:30 |also , we have a blind soldier here .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12397 6:33 |while in iraq , an explosion from a suicide car bomber destroyed his eyesight .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12398 6:40 |he 's still in the army , still on active duty .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12399 6:48 |i also found out online about another soldier who is deaf in one ear .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12400 6:54 |one of which actually started a school for the deaf in iraq .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12401 7:01 |all of this is incredible , but i am going to ask all of you-| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12402 7:05 |if the u.s. military can retain their disabled soldiers ...| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12403 7:13 |moreover , out of all the u.s. military jobs ,| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12404 7:16 |80 % are non-combat positions .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12405 7:21 |there are many jobs that we in the deaf community can do .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12406 7:26 |we can also do mechanics , finance , medicine , and on and on .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12407 7:36 |the first being , israeli defense openly accepts deaf soldiers .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12408 7:42 |second , the u.s. military has disabled soldiers .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12409 7:46 |third , 80 % of occupations in the military are non-combat .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12410 7:49 |so i ask you this ...| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12411 7:53 |can we deaf americans serve our country ?| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12412 7:55 |yes !| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12413 7:56 |of course !| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12414 7:57 |absolutely , without a doubt !| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12415 8:10 |i need to explain that for my batallion ...| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12416 8:13 |this is the first time ever they 've had a deaf cadet .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12417 8:16 |they had never experienced that before .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12418 8:19 |so , of course , they were taken back wondering ... a deaf cadet ?| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12419 8:21 |how i would do this or that ? how would we communicate and such .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12420 8:25 |which is a natural reaction ; many of them had never interacted with a deaf person before .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12421 8:31 |also , it was new for me .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12422 8:33 |it was the real thing -- i was in the army .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12423 8:35 |i had to learn a whole new world .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12424 8:38 |military jargon , its own culture and everything .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12425 8:41 |so , we started out slow and proceeded from there .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12426 8:45 |we got to know each other and learned how to work together .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12427 8:49 |for example ...| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12428 8:50 |on the first day of class i had no uniform .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12429 8:53 |i showed up in regular clothes while the other cadets were all in uniform .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12430 8:57 |i found out that every morning at 5:30 there was physical training , pt .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12431 9:06 |and occasionally , we would have weekend training at a military base .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12432 9:11 |so , i showed up that morning at 5:30 with all the cadets in uniform and me in regular clothes .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12433 9:20 |i told them , i wanted to anyway .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12434 9:21 |they acknowledged that and i continued to show up every morning to train .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12435 9:24 |when friday came , i asked to go to field training .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12436 9:28 |they told me no , and to just stick with class .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12437 9:30 |i insisted that i wanted to try .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12438 9:33 |they let me attend the lab , but only as an observer .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12439 9:36 |i could n't participate , i could only watch .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12440 9:38 |fine with me .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12441 9:39 |i showed up on friday .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12442 9:41 |they were teaching cadets marching drill commands .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12443 9:44 |standing at attention , how to properly salute , and all the basics .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12444 9:48 |i had to ask again if i could join .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12445 9:50 |i got the go ahead .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12446 9:53 |i went to get in formation .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12447 9:54 |i figured i better stand in the second line .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12448 9:57 |that way i could watch what the cadets were doing in the row ahead of me .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12449 10:01 |but the officer who `` opened the door '' for me to join the rotc program ...| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12450 10:05 |he spotted me in the back and said ,| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12451 10:15 |i thought , wow .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12452 10:19 |that made an impression| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12453 10:26 |i asked if it would be possible to get one , but they said no .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12454 10:28 |so i continued on that way .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12455 10:43 |they wanted to give me the uniform .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12456 10:45 |remarkable .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12457 10:46 |so when we went to the warehouse ...| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12458 10:51 |but they filled two duffel bags , each full with gear :| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12459 10:54 |a helmet , ammo vest , shovel , sleeping bag- the whole nine yards .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12460 11:00 |i was astonished .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12461 11:02 |i have to tell you , each morning i get up and put on my uniform ,| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12462 11:08 |i feel privileged .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12463 11:13 |so ... moving along ...| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12464 11:19 |there was liability concern , that the interpreter could get injured during the training .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12465 11:26 |we had to figure out all those issues and confusion .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12466 11:28 |but we worked it out and in the end they let me go .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12467 11:31 |that was how events unfolded ; i was slowly doing more and more .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12468 11:34 |back at the army base ...| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12469 11:36 |during one of the training days there was a huge chinook helicopter .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12470 11:41 |with its tandem rotors , landed right down to us and forcefully spun the air .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12471 11:45 |all of us cadets were supposed to be getting on board .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12472 11:47 |everyone was geared up and ready .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12473 11:54 |they were afraid if the pilot shouted out orders ...| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12474 11:56 |how would i be able to follow the instructions ?| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12475 12:00 |so i stood aside while the others were filing toward the helicopter .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12476 12:05 |i could see the cadres huddled up discussing , mulling it over .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12477 12:13 |( applause )| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12478 12:14 |i rushed over and got in . it was such a thrill .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12479 12:18 |we learned about each other and supported one another .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12480 12:28 |this is my passion .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12481 12:37 |the cadres are the officers and sergeants who oversee the rotc program .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12482 12:42 |in the beginning it was awkward .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12483 12:45 |there has been tremendous support and unity .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12484 12:47 |the cadets , my fellow peers --| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12485 12:49 |when you train and sweat together you feel the bond of camaraderie right away .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12486 12:56 |a brother or sisterly cohesiveness makes them like family .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12487 12:59 |as for training and classes ...| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12488 13:00 |we learn theories of warfare .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12489 13:02 |how to lead soldiers . how to do reconnaissance .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12490 13:06 |strategies . how to knock out a bunker .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12491 13:17 |through the national center on deafness , ncod , here at csun .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12492 13:20 |i really have to thank them .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12493 13:22 |it 's not easy to find interpreters willing to get up at 4:30 am , or sometimes even 3:30 am .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12494 13:29 |that 's the officer who e-mailed me saying i think you can have a few classes .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12495 13:34 |lieutenant mendoza .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12496 13:40 |this is from last fall when we were new to training .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12497 13:45 |this is lieutenant colonel phelps . this his name sign .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12498 13:48 |he is the commanding officer of the entire bruin battalion .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12499 14:01 |plus , he does n't view me as a deaf person .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12500 14:04 |he looks at my skills and capabilities instead .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12501 14:16 |every cadet has a mentor .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12502 14:19 |my mentor is cinatl .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12503 14:29 |this top picture is when a group of us went to las vegas| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12504 14:31 |to compete in a test to see if we can match the german troops physical training standards .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12505 14:37 |it involved swimming timed sprints , marksmanship , and numerous fitness events .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12506 14:42 |i passed them and satisfied the requirements to be awarded this badge right here .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12507 14:46 |( applause )| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12508 14:49 |this is one of the sergeants , sgt . richardson .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12509 14:52 |i love this guy . he does n't take bologna from any of us cadets .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12510 14:59 |that 's from the morning when we trekked 7 1/2 miles with a 40-lb rucksack in under two hours .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12511 15:06 |here are a few of my fellow cadets .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12512 15:14 |at right is trinidad -- i gave him this sign because he is always sarcastic .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12513 15:18 |he is a veteran , having served in iraq and afghanistan .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12514 15:23 |the female is frigo , whose nickname is refrigerator .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12515 15:28 |the cadet on the end is jarvy . he 's a top athlete .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12516 15:32 |i gave him this sign because of the scar he has here .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12517 15:36 |do you know who this is ?| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12518 15:37 |this is the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12519 15:42 |he is the highest-ranking military officer .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12520 15:43 |the principal military advisor to president obama and secretary of defense gates .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12521 15:48 |he gave a talk at ucla to a full house .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12522 15:51 |afterwards , i lined up to shake his hand .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12523 16:03 |the interpreter refrained to clarify .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12524 16:04 |he seemed confused , and quickly moved on to shake hands with the rest of the soldiers .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12525 16:24 |well , the rotc has four levels .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12526 16:31 |the third level would begin in the fall .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12527 16:33 |but in order to move up you need to pass a medical exam .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12528 16:43 |so , we sat down , and i was told that ...| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12529 16:46 |if i wanted to continue to the third level ,| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12530 16:52 |or the friday lab field trainings .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12531 16:55 |or the army base trainings .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12532 17:06 |that really hit me ; it was a huge blow .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12533 17:11 |many officers and cadets have empathized with me .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12534 17:14 |they 're shocked and wondered why this has to be the case .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12535 17:18 |my commanding officer , colonel phelps ...| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12536 17:20 |has tried to speak with the higher-ups in the chain of command| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12537 17:28 |but their response is unwavering . policy is policy .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12538 17:36 |the cadre ... has tried to find a way for me .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12539 17:40 |they found out that there is another deaf cadet .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12540 17:43 |he 's at the citadel , a military college in south carolina .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12541 17:49 |that cadet will be completing his fourth year there and graduating this may ,| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12542 17:52 |yet he 's in the same predicament as i am .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12543 17:58 |yet , all of my fellow cadets and the officers have told me not to give up .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12544 18:02 |the policy must change .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12545 18:05 |i 've started talking with people in congress .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12546 18:10 |he 's the district congressman here in la .| gtKTcPq7XBs
_*12547 18:12 |i 'm getting the ball rolling .| gtKTcPq7XBs

_*12656 2:00 |and we have the wall we know where they are .| vaWU6X9uWGc
_*12657 2:05 |so you measure it up , see if it 's snug . this one 's just a little big .| vaWU6X9uWGc
_*12658 2:12 |i 'll have to take it back to the thing . try number 15 .| vaWU6X9uWGc
_*12659 2:23 |15 , again , a little snug . 16 ?| vaWU6X9uWGc

_*12664 2:51 |these are just a tad too big.that 's alright . they 're all the same length , so maybe it 's the measurer .| vaWU6X9uWGc
_*12665 2:58 |lorella : it 's not the measuring tape . ( laughs ) it 's the person .| vaWU6X9uWGc
_*12666 3:01 |but that 's fine , i 'll trim them down for you .| vaWU6X9uWGc

_*12669 3:28 |lorella : the other day when i was kind of gimpy i came down here and i measured the| vaWU6X9uWGc
_*12670 3:32 |spaces between all the studs and then i drew a little diagram and wrote the numbers , and| vaWU6X9uWGc
_*12671 3:39 |then the measurements of each one . so now as i go through and cut them , i 'm just| vaWU6X9uWGc
_*12672 3:45 |checking them off . you can see there were several that were 14 1/2| vaWU6X9uWGc
_*12673 3:48 |so i did all of those at one time . and now i 'm just going down and getting the others .| vaWU6X9uWGc

_*13435 1:41 |2 ) the names of the deaf schools themselves must change .| o1xH-llhFoA
_*13436 2:06 |why do n't we use deaf schools instead ? more positive . that term is a direct reflection of the deaf community| o1xH-llhFoA

_*13488 0:00 |patrick is 15 years old .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13489 0:04 |he was born deaf ,| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13490 0:05 |in this remote region of northern uganda there are no schools for deaf children .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13491 0:12 |in his whole life , patrick 's never had a conversation .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13492 0:15 |hello . good ?| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13493 0:18 |his father , charles , looks after him .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13494 0:21 |they 're only able to communicate through very basic gestures .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13495 0:39 |we 've been sitting here talking about patrick in front of him and ,| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13496 0:42 |while he 's been watching us , he does n't understand what we 're saying .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13497 0:45 |it feels almost rude| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13498 0:47 |but this is what patrick 's life is like all the time .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13499 0:51 |i 'm here with someone who wants to change all that .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13500 0:55 |raymond is deaf himself and a sign language teacher .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13501 1:01 |do you think he could learn sign language ?| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13502 1:16 |this is pretty much patrick 's existence ,| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13503 1:18 |his father gestures to him what he wants him to do and when he 's| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13504 1:21 |finished he goes back to his hut to spend the rest of the day on his own .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13505 1:29 |patrick 's fate is not unusual .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13506 1:33 |the majority of deaf people in sub-saharan africa| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13507 1:35 |have never been taught sign language .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13508 1:39 |unable to communicate with others , they 're trapped in their own minds .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13509 1:51 |raymond became deaf as a child after a bout of malaria .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13510 1:56 |six months ago he travelled to the capital for intensive training| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13511 2:00 |in sign language .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13512 2:03 |now he has returned to his village to do something unprecedented .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13513 2:08 |he 's going to teach the first sign language course ever set up here| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13514 2:13 |raymond , are you nervous ?| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13515 2:22 |it is two o'clock , the first deaf students start turning up ...| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13516 2:29 |..and class begins .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13517 2:31 |the course has already started but patrick has n't turned up yet| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13518 2:34 |and i 'm worried that his father could n't convince him to leave home .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13519 2:41 |a few minutes later , patrick arrives .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13520 3:31 |patrick 's transformation is amazing .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13521 3:33 |it 's almost impossible to believe it 's the same boy we met yesterday .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13522 3:43 |new deaf students keep arriving .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13523 3:48 |many have walked miles to be here .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13524 3:52 |there 's a nine-year-old boy and an 80-year-old woman .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13525 3:58 |before the end of the class , each new student goes to the front .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13526 4:03 |the class votes on a new name for them .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13527 4:07 |this is now patrick 's sign name| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13528 4:10 |and he will use it for the rest of his life .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13529 4:13 |he has just been baptised into a whole new world .| AHfC6jqBhkk
_*13530 0:32 |i got the message right from the start .| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13531 0:35 |there were things that i completely identified with as a deaf person .| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13532 0:40 |it was wonderful to see asl on the stage in a true-to-life way| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13533 0:49 |i could relate to where the characters were coming from . the moments were so real| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13534 0:54 |... in the play| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13535 0:55 |everything was clearly and accurately portrayed .| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13536 1:09 |i 'm drawn to everything about the play - especially to the character free . i identified with her the most .| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13537 1:13 |her character speaks to the core of deaf identity .| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13538 1:16 |the scenes in asl engage me so much .| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13539 1:20 |i forget where i am and could care less about what the hearing characters have to say .| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13540 1:24 |the work has been fun and engaging . it is hard to resist not getting up on the stage to join| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13541 1:29 |the asl conversation . it is so much fun to watch .| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13542 1:37 |i see many deaf versus `` hearing '' interpersonal issues within the story .| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13543 1:41 |whether to translate or not to translate is a question .| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13544 1:46 |should one cling to their passion| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13545 1:49 |or abandon thier passion| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13546 1:53 |it 's complex .| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13547 1:55 |as i watch the performance , i consider our relationship and| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13548 1:59 |where there are parallels| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13549 2:01 |and where their are differences .| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13550 2:04 |perhaps at the end of the day we need to make time to makeup| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13551 2:14 |you 're completely right ...| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13552 2:16 |from a culturally deaf perspective| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13553 2:19 |this show is visually and| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13554 2:20 |dramatically well put together . in fact this is| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13555 2:24 |the second time in my life that i 've ever seen a director , who happens to be hearing| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13556 2:31 |work to cast a deaf actress in a production and include the cultural| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13557 2:36 |norms of deaf people on a mainstream stage| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13558 2:40 |while using asl . it is remarkable and rare .| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13559 2:47 |this is the second time in my life that| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13560 2:52 |i 've seen anything like this .| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13561 2:55 |i 'm grateful .| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13562 2:56 |i do n't care about the opinions of others who might say there was too much or too| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13563 3:00 |little asl in the show . it was there .| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13564 3:03 |asl was at the center of the stage .| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13565 3:07 |communication is the most important thing in the world . we ca n't live without it regardless of hearing status or| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13566 3:12 |one 's ability to see and regardless| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13567 3:13 |of the language that you speak . none of those things change the fact that we need| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13568 3:17 |communication to live . without it , we can not move on .| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13569 3:19 |unfortunately my husband| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13570 3:21 |who is hearing could not be here tonight because he is| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13571 3:25 |minding our dog . i was invited out this| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13572 3:27 |evening by a friend| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13573 3:30 |just the two of us without my husband but ,| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13574 3:32 |i do wish he had come tonight . we would certainly have a lot to talk about .| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13575 3:38 |now i have the opportunity to take my time to share with him in detail how much| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13576 3:43 |this show has to| Zz0RnlyUwPc
_*13577 3:45 |do with us .| Zz0RnlyUwPc

_*13600 0:01 |hi ! i wanted to expand on this music video before you watch it so that when you 're watching| K2L0M2TWZqY
_*13601 0:08 |it , you 'll have a better idea and enjoy it more .| K2L0M2TWZqY
_*13602 0:11 |a few years ago , i met and became fast friends with a girl named nicole . she is hearing .| K2L0M2TWZqY
_*13603 0:22 |as we were talking , she was telling me she had a boyfriend . so i said , `` oh ! how did you both meet ? ''| K2L0M2TWZqY
_*13604 0:27 |she said they met at the marina where she worked as a waitress at a restaurant .| K2L0M2TWZqY
_*13605 0:32 |damon worked on boats by fixing , cleaning and painting them at the same marina .| K2L0M2TWZqY
_*13606 0:41 |so when they first met , they knew something was there and quickly fell in love .| K2L0M2TWZqY
_*13607 0:47 |as she was telling me the story , it felt so much like a movie !| K2L0M2TWZqY
_*13608 0:54 |later on , i was listening to music and came across taylor swift 's `` everything has changed '' .| K2L0M2TWZqY
_*13609 1:02 |i thought , wow ! that reminds me of nicole and damon 's love story !| K2L0M2TWZqY
_*13610 1:06 |i told them about it and they gave it a listen . they were touched and had goosebumps .| K2L0M2TWZqY
_*13611 1:12 |eventually , they became engaged and started planning their wedding .| K2L0M2TWZqY
_*13612 1:19 |at the time , i started brainstorming ideas for my next asl music video and how to do it .| K2L0M2TWZqY
_*13613 1:25 |the song popped into my head and the idea to use the couple in it .| K2L0M2TWZqY
_*13614 1:33 |so i discussed it with them and they said yes and that it was a cool idea !| K2L0M2TWZqY
_*13615 1:38 |then we started talking about how we should make the video and project it at the church on their wedding day .| K2L0M2TWZqY
_*13616 1:46 |so that their families and friends can see and enjoy it .| K2L0M2TWZqY
_*13617 1:51 |such a great idea ! so , we actually went to the same exact marina where they met and saw how| K2L0M2TWZqY
_*13618 2:01 |they met , saw the little special memorable spots they had and filmed it all .| K2L0M2TWZqY
_*13619 2:10 |so the video you 're going to see is going to be a lot like how it really was for them when they met .| K2L0M2TWZqY
_*13620 2:15 |enjoy watching !| K2L0M2TWZqY
_*13621 2:28 |instrumental ( guitar playing )| K2L0M2TWZqY

_*13888 0:07 |me me holwell| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13889 0:10 |hi mindy alright by doing your see paper| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13890 0:15 |you 're really engrossed in that paper when you read about| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13891 0:18 |actually something you might be interested in| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13892 0:23 |from your perspective is a school years it 's a story about the flu| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13893 0:28 |in realize how many people get the flu| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13894 0:32 |every year in how serious it can be for some people| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13895 0:36 yeah xkXFFKBHnao
_*13896 0:40 |the flu is n't just nothing people really should learn what to do to prevent| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13897 0:45 |getting the flu| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13898 0:46 |and prevent spreading it around others actually| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13899 0:50 |i 'm a giving a talk to the staff on friday about the flu| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13900 0:54 |yeah i got an announcement on| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13901 0:59 |email are you ready i know all the topics i want to cover| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13902 1:04 |but i have n't finished all my plans yet one part i 'm struggling with| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13903 1:09 |is how to explain that the flu is spread by different influenza viruses| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13904 1:14 |do you have a good idea about how to explain| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13905 1:18 |wan na viruses day have a math teacher| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13906 1:22 |here the jurors but you always explain things so clearly| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13907 1:29 |i really admire that well you can explain| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13908 1:33 |that a fire is is like good sure| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13909 1:36 |is sold tiny you can even see it with a microscope| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13910 1:40 |it gets into people 's bodies usually through| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13911 1:44 |reading it in or having virus on their hands and then touching their noses| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13912 1:48 |their mouth| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13913 1:49 |in once inside your body the virus spreads| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13914 1:52 |and can cause infections in humans is mmm| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13915 1:56 |that 's good very clear and| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13916 2:00 |the flu that many people get in the fall wenger| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13917 2:03 |each year is caused by| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13918 2:06 |the at flu virus well| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13919 2:12 |there 's not just one flu virus there are many| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13920 2:15 |really i thought there was only one| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13921 2:19 ono xkXFFKBHnao
_*13922 2:22 |other different viruses and the viruses change every year| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13923 2:27 |that 's why the seasonal flu vaccine changes every year| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13924 2:30 |seasonal by| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13925 2:34 |yes one word refers to the major flu outbreaks the tend to occur between fall| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13926 2:39 |and winter| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13927 2:40 |the annual flu season in the flu vaccine is different every year| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13928 2:47 |yes usually sciences research| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13929 2:51 |which flu viruses or spreading and which are most likely to cause illness the| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13930 2:55 |next clue season| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13931 2:57 |then the vaccine is| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13932 3:00 |updated each year so they fight the most recent flu viruses| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13933 3:04 |wow some easing| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13934 3:07 |i did n't realize that this science in making the flu vaccines whistle| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13935 3:12 |complicated it is| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13936 3:16 |scientists work hard to be sure that the flu vaccine| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13937 3:20 |will be as effective as possible for each flu season| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13938 3:24 |he and that 's why it 's so important to get a flu vaccination| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13939 3:29 |every year even if you had one last year new| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13940 3:33 |vaccination every year because the flu viruses can be different every year| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13941 3:37 |interesting makes its hey| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13942 3:42 |i heard some people say they do n't want to get a flu vaccine| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13943 3:46 |because the vaccine itself might cause them to become sick with the flu| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13944 3:50 |true nola a flu vaccination can not give you the flu| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13945 3:56 |that 's a false rumor that many people unfortunately believe| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13946 4:00 |it 's too bad because people who avoid getting a flu vaccination| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13947 4:04 |actually increasing their risk of getting the flu| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13948 4:07 |i c but i heard some people who feel well| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13949 4:12 |after getting their yearly flu vaccine now| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13950 4:19 |that 's different sometimes the flu shot makes the person 's upper arm feel a| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13951 4:23 |little sore| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13952 4:24 |or they develop a slight fever or muscle aches| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13953 4:28 |but that goes away in about two days no one gets the flu| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13954 4:32 |because it the flu vaccination less good to know| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13955 4:38 |here asking a lot a great questions| xkXFFKBHnao
_*13956 4:42 |i 'll be sure to add these points to my flu presentation| xkXFFKBHnao

_*14291 0:00 |ready for something real ? welcome to infinity 2 global . i2g .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14292 0:05 |a long term world-wide online opportunity !| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14293 0:07 |i2g is involved in two huge online areas that are trending right now all over the world .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14294 0:13 |people already do both everyday . the only difference is ... they 're not getting paid for it .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14295 0:17 |first , is social media . online communication and online marketing . that 's an over $ 250 billion industry| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14296 0:24 |right now.think facebook , twitter , youtube ... social media has become a household name .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14297 0:30 |i2g introduced i2g touch . it gets you involved in this social media space and you| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14298 0:37 |get paid to share it . i2g touch gives you the ability to have all your social networks in one place| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14299 0:42 |and also have your own channel where you can video chat , live broadcast ,| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14300 0:47 |as well as post unlimited videos , audios , and images . the second area is online gaming .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14301 0:53 |that means an online casino with virtual games and live dealers .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14302 0:58 |last year online gaming did over $ 45 billion dollars world wide and its predicted to do over $ 150 billion by 2015 .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14303 1:05 |it 's going to triple in the next two years . the industry is highly regulated .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14304 1:12 |the best license to have is called tier 1 . i2g is teamed up with an already existing online gaming company| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14305 1:17 |that has a tier 1 license and is over 10 years-old .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14306 1:24 |that allows you to immediately start marketing this form of entertainment . ceasar 's entertainment announced| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14307 1:30 |that they were going into the online gaming space.their stock rose 14.3 % that day .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14308 1:38 |other giants have followed suit . but here 's what i2g gives you that nobody else ever will ...| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14309 1:46 |profits !| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14310 1:48 |traditional casino companies may give you an air-fare , a room , a buffet ... but they wo n't| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14311 1:51 |be sharing their profits with you . i2g will ! in fact , i2g shares 75 % of the online gaming| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14312 2:00 |profits brought in world wide from the online casino with you . we 're already open for business| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14313 2:06 |in over 85 countries . it 's the opportunity of a lifetime to get your peace of what all| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14314 2:12 |the big boys are now understanding to be very , very profitable . to have a big company like| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14315 2:16 |this you need a great management team . mr. rick maike is our president and ceo . he 's been| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14316 2:23 |involved as an owner for 15 years with two companies generating hundreds of millions| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14317 2:27 |of dollars in sales worldwide . he wanted to start a company that was easily accessible| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14318 2:32 |to a global market . a virtual company , with no borders . and the ability to expand globally .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14319 2:39 |in a place where he could put the extra money into your pockets by sharing profits through| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14320 2:43 |the i2g rewards and compensation . the name of the company is `` infinity , '' which means| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14321 2:49 |you get paid to infinity.the number `` 2 , '' means you have two teams . `` global '' means its available| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14322 2:57 |world wide . and we are seeing some remarkable results happening for our people in just a| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14323 3:03 |short period of time . it could n't be more exciting.there are six ways to get paid . it 's $ 19.95 to get| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14324 3:12 |started . and then you can choose packages anywhere from as little as $ 100 , $ 400 , $ 600| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14325 3:18 |or $ 5000 for the emperor package . each one has all kinds of benefits . we 'll show you| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14326 3:24 |what those are . you could pick the one that 's right for you . the first way to get paid is| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14327 3:29 |with the fast start bonuses . you make 10 % of all packages you sell , no matter what package| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14328 3:35 |it is . in by friday , and paid out by the following friday.the # 2 way to get paid is what we call| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14329 3:42 |`` dual team '' or `` binary income . '' every time you complete 300 points on team 1 , and 300| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14330 3:49 |points on team 2 , you are going to receive pay . this could be anywhere from $ 30 if your| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14331 3:55 |a novice , $ 40 as a player ( which is the $ 400-package ) , $ 50 as a high roller ( which is the $ 600-package ) ,| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14332 4:04 |and $ 60 as an emperor ( the $ 5000-package ) . if you like to make the max amount of money| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14333 4:10 |for doing the same amount of work , you can see that if you decide to choose the emperor| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14334 4:15 |package , you can make the maximum amount of money , for the same amount of work . you choose .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14335 4:21 |it 's important to know that if you maximize , just this one way to get paid , you can earn| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14336 4:26 |up to a maximum of $ 35,000 per week , or $ 1.8 million per year . and that 's for all positions .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14337 4:35 |now we have a third way to get paid . by helping others become successful , you get matching| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14338 4:40 |bonuses and it 's a very lucrative way to make money . there 's an unlimited amount| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14339 4:44 |of money available for you to earn with matching bonuses . these bonuses flow through five levels .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14340 4:51 |you get 20 % on the first , 15 % on the second , 10 % on the third , 10 % on the fourth , and 10 %| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14341 4:57 |on the fifth . the emperor is grandfathered at all five levels for one year . and , there| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14342 5:04 |are some very special benefits that we 'll share in a moment . do n't underestimate this| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14343 5:09 |bonus . every week it 's putting significant amounts of money into people 's hands . the| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14344 5:13 |novice position is not able to participate in matching bonuses . part of the i2g magic| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14345 5:20 |is that , as people are playing in the online casino , 25 % of all the chips bet also counts| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14346 5:27 |toward volume in your group , in addition to packages and orders . as an example , if our| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14347 5:33 |online gaming site happens to achieve $ 100 million in revenue ... that would mean| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14348 5:40 |$ 25 million in volume would come into the group . all from real customers and real people playing .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14349 5:47 |and this gets you to those ranks we just mentioned even faster , and closer| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14350 5:52 |to each of those generous one-time leadership bonuses . the sixth way to get paid is our| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14351 5:59 |emperor pool . for emperors only . emperor , is a special position , right now .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14352 6:05 |there 's a founder 's emperor position/package , and it 's this : if you become an emperor , you 're| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14353 6:10 |grandfathered at all positions . you could make all the leadership bonuses , all five| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14354 6:15 |levels of matching bonuses , plus -- as an emperor -- you earn 50 % of the world wide profits from| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14355 6:23 |the online gaming site , for the rest of the life of i2g . now this only lasts until the| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14356 6:29 |first 5000 emperors have joined the company . after that , it will change . and the 50 % of| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14357 6:36 |online gaming profits may be gone . you have an opportunity of a lifetime . to make an income| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14358 6:41 |from all of the customers to distributors playing on the online gaming site worldwide .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14359 6:46 |imagine the possibilities . right now , people are earning more money in one week ,| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14360 6:51 |than most people make in a year . and it 's just the beginning . we 're looking for people who want to have fun ,| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14361 6:57 |help us spread the wealth and become very , very successful themselves .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14362 7:02 |it 's a dream come-true . make it happen for you ... now !| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14363 7:09 |: :music : :| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14364 7:20 |`` yeah . i 'm doing well . i 'm not very techy . um , i have a world wide organization and i do n't even know how to use skype .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14365 7:26 |last year was a tough year for me , financially . the top thing , the worst things that could happen to someone ...| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14366 7:34 |first of all i had a bankruptcy . second of all i had a repossession of my car .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14367 7:38 |and third of all , i had a foreclosure on my house . could n't get much worse than that .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14368 7:42 |and then thank god with i2g in my first month , august 3rd i started , i made more money than most people make in a year .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14369 7:49 |and then last week ... last week ... in one week the sixth week .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14370 7:54 |in made the same amount of money . so ... it 's just changed from rags to riches so to speak .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14371 7:59 |i 've been a real estate broker for over 25 years . and i 've also been in direct selling for about 25 years .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14372 8:05 |and so i 've been through a lot of different companies . and when i saw this . it just fit my lifestyle .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14373 8:12 |because i do n't like to push a product ... like a nutrition , or a skin care ... because people leave and come and go ,| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14374 8:19 |and then your income goes up and down . but with gambling ... even if they do n't do the business ,| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14375 8:25 |if they wa n't to quit the business , you 're not going to be losing that income ,| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14376 8:27 |because they 're always going to gamble from their own casino .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14377 8:31 |this one 's different . we 're going to have that aspect but more importantly , what 's going to really dwarf it ,| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14378 8:39 |is the number of people that are just customers , or gamblers , that just want to gamble from their own site .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14379 8:44 |they do n't even care about the compensation plan .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14380 8:47 |so , and 25 % of whatever they bet , wether they win or lose , goes into that compensation plan .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14381 8:52 |that 's exciting !| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14382 8:54 |i 'm not a gambler . i 've never gambled in my life . i never bought a lottery ticket .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14383 8:57 |but when i found out about i2g , i actually ... the first two weeks after i heard about it ,| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14384 9:02 |i heard from kiplinger report , cnbc , knx the local radio station ,| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14385 9:07 |that the coming `` thing '' is online gaming and also social media .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14386 9:13 |so that 's when i went to work .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14387 9:14 |i do n't care if online gaming ever becomes legal although according to these sources they will| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14388 9:20 |in the next two years .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14389 9:21 |because as long as it 's legal for us to get paid in the united states , just like everybody else in the world ,| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14390 9:25 |then i 'm in !| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14391 9:31 |people are interested . i could leave a short message on their voicemail box ,| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14392 9:34 |if i do n't reach them in person . and then i send them a recording| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14393 9:37 |of one of the calls that we did so that they understand what it 's all about .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14394 9:42 |and then i can answer any question . i 've done that , and people who| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14395 9:45 |... maybe they have n't returned my call in the last five years| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14396 9:49 |on whatever business i was working , they say , `` dennis ! now you have my attention ! ''| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14397 9:54 |you do n't want to keep it a secret . you want to tell everybody you know about it| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14398 9:58 |let them look at it . and that 's it . you sort .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14399 9:59 |some people are going to see it . some people are n't .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14400 10:02 |and some people will see it later if they do n't see it now because it might be to early for them .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14401 10:06 |but i had great success right up from the bat , or from the gecko , and it just encouraged me| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14402 10:12 |more and more . and now it 's very easy .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14403 10:15 |i 've learned this for over 25 years . you just want to go out of the gate .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14404 10:17 |you want to do your diligence quickly , and then , and then just do it .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14405 10:21 |either you join us , or you do n't .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14406 10:24 |i have n't talked to people international myself but i have people that have put me on the line| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14407 10:31 |with people in hungary , in asia , in canada , mexico , all over .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14408 10:37 |a lot of people in this country , because it is a melting pot ,| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14409 10:39 |when you mention that we 're already open in korea , for instance ,| 1Ixmdrc2YwM
_*14410 10:44 |and you 're talking to a korean-american . they get excited .| 1Ixmdrc2YwM

_*14803 3:12 |my son has mild asthma| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14804 3:15 |i moved upstate in february| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14805 3:25 |suddenly , about three weeks ago| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14806 3:28 |my daughter caught a virus| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14807 3:33 |started coughing , about three weeks ago| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14808 3:41 |so immediately i saw my family doctor| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14809 3:44 |he checked everything| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14810 3:49 |which was a little low , and gave me an inhaler| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14811 3:51 |so fine , i used the inhaler| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14812 3:53 |then i took my family on vacation| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14813 3:57 |to long island| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14814 3:59 |where i grew up| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14815 4:00 |went for a week and felt better| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14816 4:04 |still coughing a little| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14817 4:06 |finished our vacation , went home| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14818 4:09 |came back sunday , two weeks ago| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14819 4:14 |arrived home , and the struggling increased| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14820 4:19 |with my breathing| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14821 4:22 |by monday , my breathing was worse| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14822 4:30 |so i decided to go to urgent care| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14823 4:33 |my doctor was not available , so i went in| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14824 4:37 |was examined , my oxygen was low| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14825 4:40 |got an x-ray| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14826 4:42 |and they found a little pneumonia| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14827 4:44 |in my lower right lungs| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14828 4:46 |the radiologist said nothing was clear| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14829 4:49 |but the doctor disagreed| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14830 4:51 |so he gave me z-pak and the same old antibiotics| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14831 4:58 |i took the meds , went home| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14832 5:00 |still struggled breathing| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14833 5:03 |on through to the evening , when it got worse| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14834 5:06 |i noticed my lungs contracting| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14835 5:11 |my husband decided| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14836 5:18 |an asthma machine| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14837 5:20 |it helped a little| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14838 5:23 |i believe it bought some time| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14839 5:26 |so i used the nebulizer| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14840 5:29 |and breathed a little better| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14841 5:31 |but then my lungs contracted worse| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14842 5:36 |air was coming in but not going out| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14843 5:40 |i struggled until about 1 to 1:30am| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14844 5:50 |my husband called 911| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14845 5:52 |i was rushed to the emergency room| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14846 5:55 |i was alert , but struggled to breathe| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14847 6:10 |my respiratory system contracted , closed up| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14848 6:17 |i was sent for a ct scan| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14849 6:19 |that was awful , you know , laying down in a tube| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14850 6:22 |i struggled through that and made it| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14851 6:26 |got out , went back to the er| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14852 6:34 |a crew of doctors surrounded me| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14853 6:38 |and forced me into an induced coma| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14854 6:42 |and put me on life support| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14855 6:46 |they told my husband to contact family| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14856 6:49 |because i may die| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14857 6:52 |he called my family| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14858 6:53 |for 28 hours i was in a coma| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14859 6:57 |on life support .| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14860 7:02 |that happened on july 10th| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14861 7:08 |tuesday night through wednesday morning july 10th| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14862 7:13 |family flew in and drove in| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14863 7:18 |while i was out with| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14864 7:21 |a tube down my throat on a machine| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14865 7:24 |the doctors wanted my lungs to rest| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14866 7:29 |and let the machines take care of my body| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14867 7:31 |all my organs were fine| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14868 7:36 |except my lungs had collapsed| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14869 7:39 |then july 10th went , on to thursday afternoon| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14870 7:44 |i started going in and out of awareness| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14871 7:49 |my family encouraged me to breathe| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14872 7:52 |until i could breathe on my own| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14873 7:58 |then they took me off life support| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14874 8:01 |i was disoriented| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14875 8:05 |my family surrounded me| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14876 8:09 |i was lost for 28 hours| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14877 8:11 |where am i ?| jmoXVGvxe34

_*14880 9:04 |clearly !| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14881 9:18 |it is such a powerful and beautiful place| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14882 9:22 |i was mounted on a white winged horse| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14883 9:27 |saddled up on a mountaintop| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14884 9:38 |beautiful story , but the horn| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14885 9:40 |was not on the front , but the back of the head| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14886 9:43 |i was holding on , and felt| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14887 9:46 |i really saw and smelled everything that happened| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14888 9:56 |white-grey mixed pole| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14889 10:00 |which felt cold while i was mounted| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14890 10:03 |it was a beautiful horse| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14891 10:16 |i felt i was bonded| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14892 10:19 |to that animal in a past life| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14893 10:22 |i was holding on and riding| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14894 10:25 |then , i looked over and saw a beautiful angel| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14895 10:31 |tall.. and i mean big , huge !| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14896 10:38 |he looked like a warrior in a white robe| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14897 10:42 |he was handsome| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14898 10:44 |with radiant eyes| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14899 10:46 |this was all crystal clear !| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14900 10:49 |he was a loving and peaceful man| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14901 10:54 |with mid-length light brown hair| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14902 10:57 |he stood and looked at me| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14903 10:59 |i was on the horse , and i had to look up| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14904 11:02 |he had to be 8 feet tall| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14905 11:05 |his hands were big| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14906 11:09 |how did we communicate ?| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14907 11:13 |did we sign or speak ?| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14908 11:28 |i held on and rode| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14909 11:30 |you know how a horse can gallop very wildly ?| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14910 11:35 |well i rode very light and easy| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14911 11:38 |we travelled up through space| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14912 11:43 |and the stars were beautiful| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14913 11:47 |as we rode| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14914 11:49 |back down through mountains| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14915 11:56 |the sky above us was crystal clear blue| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14916 12:01 |without a cloud in the sky| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14917 12:10 |the air was the best ! clean and perfectly pure| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14918 12:16 |i felt a could smell everything| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14919 12:21 |across the mountains and waters| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14920 12:24 |i saw a pond| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14921 12:26 |with flowers that illuminated| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14922 12:31 |with glowing colors| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14923 12:34 |and the flowers had feelings with spirits| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14924 12:39 |so hard to describe| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14925 12:41 |really beautiful| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14926 12:44 |that was one part of my experience| jmoXVGvxe34
_*14927 12:50 |i stood with the same angel| jmoXVGvxe34

_*15806 0:11 |we often have guests on , who talk about sound money , or regulations| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15807 0:16 |but how about an entire new , not just economic system| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15808 0:20 |but social system , too ?| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15809 0:22 |it sounds obviously very radical but that is just what| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15810 0:25 |peter joseph of the zeitgeist movement is arguing for| 2RDihFrV_Os

_*15812 0:30 |peter , it 's so nice to have you on the show . i 'll just get right to it .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15813 0:34 |we have guests on the show who advocate for different solutions| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15814 0:38 |to the criticisms of the current economic system| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15815 0:40 |from debt jubilees to better regulations , private industry| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15816 0:45 |sounder money . you argue for just| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15817 0:47 |getting rid of free market capitalism as we know it| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15818 0:50 |and completely overhauling the social system .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15819 0:53 |why do you think that 's the solution ?| 2RDihFrV_Os

_*15821 0:59 |and thank you , lauren , for having me| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15822 1:01 |the real crutch here is the structural and psychological flaws| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15823 1:05 |that this system creates . the unemployment crisis , the debt crisis| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15824 1:08 |the public health crisis , the poverty crisis| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15825 1:11 |the energy crisis that 's looming| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15826 1:13 |and the immense social destabilization you 're seeing| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15827 1:16 |are actually systemic causes of| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15828 1:18 |the fatal flaws of this system at the core logic .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15829 1:21 |i can expand on any one of those topics that you like .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15830 1:23 |if you take what you just covered in this broadcast :| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15831 1:26 |the unemployment crisis . - ok| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15832 1:28 |- the unemployment crisis is really driven by technology .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15833 1:30 |that 's very important for people to understand because| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15834 1:32 |unfortunately many are n't talking about this .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15835 1:34 |we have an exponential increase in information technology| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15836 1:37 |coupled with invention , material invention , manufacturing| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15837 1:40 |and all the other sectors , the service sectors| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15838 1:42 |design revolutions that are happening with artificial intelligence| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15839 1:45 |eliminating the necessity for human occupations| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15840 1:48 |and it 's exponentially increasing , and increasing more rapidly| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15841 1:51 |as this decline occurs because| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15842 1:53 |it 's more affordable for corporations to automate .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15843 1:56 |they do n't have to pay insurance and vacations .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15844 1:58 |if you look closely , this is the systemic element .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15845 2:01 |does that mean technology is bad ? no , it means that| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15846 2:03 |human evolution is moving in a certain path| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15847 2:05 |that is literally making obsolete the current social system| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15848 2:09 |in that attribute that i 've just mentioned| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15849 2:10 |but i 'll pause there and let you continue . - thank you| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15850 2:12 |and we 'll get more into this . to stick to what you brought up| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15851 2:14 |which is jobs we were talking about , certainly| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15852 2:16 |you can talk about the technological component of job loss| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15853 2:19 |but let me get to another one , what about , just for example| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15854 2:22 |the industry of construction in this country| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15855 2:24 |which we saw kind of totally decimated| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15856 2:27 |with the housing bubble , which popped| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15857 2:29 |and this gets to the issue of debt , which i know is an issue| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15858 2:32 |that you talk about . can you talk about the role of debt| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15859 2:35 |and the limitations of it in our monetary system ?| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15860 2:40 |- well , sure . you kind of have this bubble equality with debt .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15861 2:43 |you notice many people talk about debt jubilee| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15862 2:46 |and debt forgiveness now . i heard one economist say| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15863 2:48 |that we should just forgive debt every 50 years| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15864 2:51 |and that does n't really address the fundamental problem , does it ?| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15865 2:54 |basically we have our money produced out of debt .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15866 2:56 |money 's made out of debt , whether it comes from the central banks| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15867 2:59 |or from the private banks . the private banks manipulate money| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15868 3:02 |loan it at interest to people , and there 's the interest component| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15869 3:05 |which does n't exist in the money supply .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15870 3:07 |you have an infinite amount of debt , increasing constantly| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15871 3:10 |throughout the entire world| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15872 3:12 |and that is why we are in the staggering state that we 're in| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15873 3:16 |suffocating us on so many different levels :| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15874 3:18 |just look at medical debts , look at student loan debts| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15875 3:20 |look at all of the deprivation that 's being caused of that .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15876 3:23 |that 's one side of it , which is| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15877 3:25 |to my view , a completely sick social experiment .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15878 3:29 |it 's a horrible thing to do to human society| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15879 3:31 |even impose this fictional element on them , to impose them| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15880 3:34 |which brings me to my other point , which is that| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15881 3:36 |debt serves as a form of ( for lack of better expression ) slavery .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15882 3:39 |it 's an imposition of scarcity , which forces people into positions| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15883 3:42 |that they typically would n't take for their purposes of integrity or education| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15884 3:46 |but they have to , usually at less expense to the corporations .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15885 3:50 |in a way , it 's great for the corporate system on a certain level| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15886 3:53 |to a certain threshold , to have many inhibited people that have no freedom| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15887 3:57 |to be in debt . a running joke in my community is that| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15888 4:00 |when you get out of college , most likely you have $ 80,000 worth of debt .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15889 4:03 |you 're 'ripe ' to be enslaved into a corporate system| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15890 4:06 |that does n't have to give in to your interests or take care of you .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15891 4:08 |- you argue debt is slavery ; you have some other criticisms of it as well .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15892 4:12 |we 've seen the cause of it right now in so many of the issues| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15893 4:15 |that we cover everyday on this show : in the eurozone crisis| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15894 4:19 |with public debt , that 's obviously just one side of it .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15895 4:21 |my question then : is this why you want to ditch the monetary system| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15896 4:25 |and if so how do you reward work and sacrifice that people make ?| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15897 4:31 |- the removal of the monetary system i believe will occur| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15898 4:34 |regardless of my intents . it 's a natural evolution of human society .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15899 4:38 |all the mechanisms that have kept this system in place are phasing out| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15900 4:42 |by default , and the social destabilization that 's on the horizon| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15901 4:45 |( i do n't even have to do anything , i 'm just trying to help )| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15902 4:47 |is going to cause some type of change| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15903 4:49 |and i hope , and the people that i work with , we hope| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15904 4:52 |it will move into sane direction and not something equally as sinister| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15905 4:56 |as what we 've been seeing for the past 20 generations .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15906 5:00 |the issue of incentive is a common supporting argument| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15907 5:04 |with respect to how people defend the free market system .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15908 5:07 |they say `` if people do n't have a direct material incentive to work| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15909 5:10 |( a reward , carrot stick ) then they wo n't have any initiative to do so . ''| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15910 5:14 |the first thing i would say , is that scientifically a lot of research 's been done| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15911 5:17 |to show when it comes to creative interests| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15912 5:19 |people are not motivated by money .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15913 5:21 |money seems to be inhibiting people 's creative effects .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15914 5:25 |it 's only mechanical operations like working on a factory line| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15915 5:28 |or waiting tables ( things that can easily be automated| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15916 5:31 |if we applied our technology ) that people need that reward| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15917 5:34 |because it 's so mundane .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15918 5:36 |the true ability and best resource on the planet is the human mind| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15919 5:39 |and to free that mind , to enable it to be creative .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15920 5:41 |that 's the beauty of our technological evolution at this point .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15921 5:44 |on a second level , noting that scientific validity| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15922 5:47 |that incentive is not always the case for people to be operational| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15923 5:50 |we have other incentives in society that are not directly material| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15924 5:54 |that are very rewarding that if people broaden their horizon| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15925 5:56 |they would see . the incentive to be able to walk out of your home| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15926 5:59 |and not be worried about someone robbing you| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15927 6:01 |because they live in a deprived environment :| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15928 6:03 |pointing a gun and taking your resources| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15929 6:05 |putting all those locks on our doors .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15930 6:06 |most of the crime we see in the world is related to money| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15931 6:09 |one way or another and deprivation through the monetary system .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15932 6:12 |another incentive is the removal of war , the removal of poverty .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15933 6:15 |imagine having the satisfaction of knowing there are n't one billion people| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15934 6:18 |starving on this planet ? there is a deeply social element in us| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15935 6:22 |that is coming to fruition . it has to for our survival .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15936 6:25 |i believe that our personal interest must become social interest| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15937 6:28 |it has to . it really is already there , but we just do n't know it yet .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15938 6:31 |we do n't think about it that way .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15939 6:33 |until that happens we have a lot of big things on the horizon .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15940 6:35 |one final point i 'll say about incentive , how about this as a classic example ?| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15941 6:39 |we have all sorts of immense military revolutions happening right now .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15942 6:41 |they 're going to make the atomic bomb look like a roman catapult .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15943 6:45 |what 's going to happen when we have these advanced technologies| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15944 6:48 |and the immature society we do now based on this| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15945 6:51 |farce social darwinism , this tribal mentality| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15946 6:54 |this sovereign war mentality : everyone fighting amongst themselves| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15947 6:57 |the assumption that we ca n't get along .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15948 6:59 |what 's going to happen when we have the advanced technologies| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15949 7:01 |that can be pulled off the shelf , through molecular engineering| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15950 7:04 |that can wipe out whole continents on a whim ?| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15951 7:06 |this is a very real thing and in the words of albert einstein :| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15952 7:08 |`` our technology has exceeded our humanity . ''| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15953 7:11 |it 's very important that our values come in line| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15954 7:13 |and that 's explicit to our new socially-conscious revolution| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15955 7:17 |that has to come from the basis of the economic system .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15956 7:20 |- peter , there is so much more i want to get to because you have| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15957 7:23 |so many interesting points of view that i want to get more into .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15958 7:25 |since we last spoke , occupy wall street has happened| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15959 7:30 |where we see people protesting the economic system| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15960 7:33 |on the streets of the us . i want to talk about more of these things .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15961 7:36 |we 're going to go to a quick break but we will be back| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15962 7:38 |with director and filmmaker peter joseph .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15963 7:42 |with occupy wall street all over the nation| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15964 7:45 |we have seen people come out onto the streets| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15965 7:47 |to protest the economic system itself| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15966 7:50 |and director and filmmaker peter joseph is one| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15967 7:53 |who advocates for a total overhaul .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15968 7:55 |we 're going to get more into what he thinks of this movement| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15969 7:58 |and what he thinks of changes to the economic system .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15970 8:01 |peter , let 's get back into this because as i said| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15971 8:04 |occupy wall street is on the streets , protesting the economic system .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15972 8:07 |it 's also a leaderless movement .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15973 8:09 |i 'm curious if you see| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15974 8:12 |them as having their intentions in the right place ?| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15975 8:17 |- intentions absolutely , but until answers are proposed| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15976 8:20 |until people get together and think about the solution| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15977 8:23 |not much is going to be accomplished unfortunately .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15978 8:25 |it 's an awareness protest movement . it 's really important what they 're doing .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15979 8:28 |i think it 's really another systemic outgrowth of destabilization .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15980 8:31 |i 've been expecting this type of thing to happen for a long time .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15981 8:35 |occupy wall street and the global occupy movement| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15982 8:38 |( which is really the most important attribute of it| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15983 8:40 |because this is n't just about wall street| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15984 8:42 |this is n't just about the us ) .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15985 8:44 |it is really about the total global financial system| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15986 8:46 |and the inherent flaws of the market system| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15987 8:48 |even though many people in the movement do n't even discuss those issues .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15988 8:52 |they 're just expressing their angst and rightly so .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15989 8:54 |what i would like to state though , is that| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15990 8:56 |the 1 % are not something to be demonized per se .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15991 8:59 |the 1 % are simply the best game players in this game strategy| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15992 9:03 |that 's been generated . the 99 % have let the 1 % come to their place| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15993 9:09 |as easily as anything because the 99 % have been supporting| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15994 9:13 |all the mechanisms that enabled the 1 % .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15995 9:15 |this system is based on a structural classism .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15996 9:18 |it 's always in favor of the wealthy and| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15997 9:19 |i do n't mean that just from lobbying and government intervention .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15998 9:22 |the very basis of the structure from the banking , the loan| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*15999 9:25 |and interest system , really support that .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16000 9:28 |if the occupy movement really wants to get down to brass tacks| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16001 9:31 |they 're really going to have start addressing these root issues| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16002 9:34 |that i talk about , that my movement talks about| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16003 9:36 |and many others talk about , and then think about| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16004 9:38 |what the solution is . i really believe in the buckminster fuller notion| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16005 9:42 |that it 's not about fighting some system anymore .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16006 9:44 |it 's about building a new design that makes the other one obsolete| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16007 9:48 |and getting the public to understand it , and then the game is basically over .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16008 9:51 |- it 's a kind of evolution that you talk about but i 'm just really curious| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16009 9:54 |how you do that , and how long you see that needing to take| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16010 9:57 |because i do n't know if you saw the black friday videos| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16011 10:00 |of people attacking each other for $ 2 waffle-makers ?| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16012 10:03 |i 'm going to play a tiny montage for our audience .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16013 10:06 |i 'm sure you can imagine from the noise what 's going on in them .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16014 10:10 |( crowd noise )| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16015 10:21 |( security guard ) everybody get back !| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16016 10:28 |( siren hoots )| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16017 10:35 |- peter , it sounds like riots , it looks a little like riots| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16018 10:38 |unfortunately it 's people clamoring for video games .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16019 10:40 |i would n't want to get caught up in between them and their video games .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16020 10:42 |how do you get between them and their video games| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16021 10:45 |and how long is that going to take ?| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16022 10:47 |- good question . i 'd like to point out that before world war ii| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16023 10:50 |consumption in america was half of what it is now per person .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16024 10:54 |the ravenous consumption mentality| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16025 10:56 |has really been imposed on culture by advertising| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16026 10:59 |and it 's very important that people see that .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16027 11:02 |when you see that aberrant behavior of such| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16028 11:04 |it 's really a cultural anomaly . we need that in the market system| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16029 11:08 |to enable consumption to be as rampant as possible| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16030 11:11 |to keep this infinite growth paradigm going unfortunately .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16031 11:15 |how do you change that issue , is that your question ? - yes| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16032 11:18 |- how do you get people to see the light ?| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16033 11:20 |- absolutely ! to put down those video games .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16034 11:23 |- yes , as though those are life-supporting elements anyway . - exactly .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16035 11:27 |- nevertheless , there is a massive educational paradigm| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16036 11:31 |that i ca n't talk about enough .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16037 11:34 |the social breakdown of society is going to open minds .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16038 11:37 |this is the bio-social pressure that has basically| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16039 11:39 |caused every major shift in human society .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16040 11:42 |the problems that are on the horizon are going to slowly| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16041 11:44 |get everyone to step back and say `` what do we do now ? ''| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16042 11:47 |that 's where i think the importance of| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16043 11:49 |you and everyone who 's aware of this| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16044 11:52 |have to get together and show people what a solution can be| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16045 11:55 |get them on board , and get a mass movement| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16046 11:58 |to enable it to come forward .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16047 12:00 |that sounds very simplistic and it 's an over-generalization| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16048 12:03 |but it 's not going to happen through government policy .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16049 12:05 |governments are far too interlocked today into corporate institutions .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16050 12:08 |governments are corporations ! all the us government is| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16051 12:11 |is a parent corporation of all the subsidies| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16052 12:13 |known as the 'industry central ' .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16053 12:15 |that 's really all the us government does . it 's funded , supported| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16054 12:18 |and regulated by corporations . it always was by the way .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16055 12:20 |this is n't some anomaly that occurred .| 2RDihFrV_Os
_*16056 12:22 |it 's just the nature of the game . we should n't expect anything less .| 2RDihFrV_Os

_*16754 0:57 |i 'm the third generation . my grandmother retired last year and recently turned 80 ! she was also a hair stylist .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16755 1:05 |she used to own a salon .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16756 1:08 |i guess it must be in the blood !| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16757 1:13 |i graduated from college - fidm - and my goal was to become a set designer for films . so , i went into that .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16758 1:24 |my first job - i hated my first job . everything that could go wrong went wrong ! i was very frustrated .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16759 1:34 |i met a make up artist at that job and started talking . i watched her work and enjoyed it immensely .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16760 1:44 |i decided to give it a go and enrolled into a make up school . and i fell in love with it !| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16761 1:53 |i did n't really know what `` being on set '' mean .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16762 1:57 |i did n't know all of the lingo or terminology that people yelled out during filming . like `` quiet '' or `` rolling . ''| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16763 2:05 |just basic terminology .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16764 2:07 |i did n't learn that in make up school so i had to teach myself to listen and learn .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16765 2:12 |after a job is wrapped up - meaning you finished the job - you appreciate all that you 've done . that 's the goal .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16766 2:18 |it 's a hard goal but it 's fun at the same time .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16767 2:21 |a story : i showed up at this job . i thought i was going to do just the make up but soon found out i had to do the hair too .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16768 2:29 |this is common in the industry . oftentimes they will inform you that they need someone to do the hair . but then later you| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16769 2:36 |find out that they need someone to do both the hair and make up . they 're not always clear .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16770 2:42 |this is important : do n't rely on just phone calls . make sure to email , that way you can have documents .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16771 2:47 |men shave first thing in the morning and after filming for 12 , 13 hours a day - by noon , 2 in the afternoon , they will| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16772 3:01 |develop what is known as a 5 o'clock shadow . a blueish scruff . when a man stands in front of a camera , you can tell| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16773 3:08 |immediately . they need constant make up work . they ca n't keep shaving because then they become susceptible to razor burns ,| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16774 3:16 |which are red bumps on their face . this makes the situation worse . that 's part of my job , to keep an eye on the screen -| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16775 3:26 |`` oh it 's blue ! '' - and make sure to fix the blue scruff whenever it appears .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16776 3:31 |at the first production company i worked for - and i 'm still with them ! i 've been with them for 12 years now .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16777 3:42 |one of the producers - she signs !| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16778 3:47 |so , that was my way of getting a foot in the door .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16779 3:56 |it 's a difficult industry but she really helped and taught me a lot .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16780 4:04 |i really enjoy working with her . sometimes when we work on set - for instance , in a warehouse - the way it is set up ,| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16781 4:16 |when people are talking , the voices seem to disappear . so , i miss out on some information . the director , instead| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16782 4:22 |of yelling out , will use a laser pointer to get my attention . if i 'm just standing there , minding my own business , and they| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16783 4:32 |need me on set , they will use the laser pointer to get my attention . `` oh , it 's my turn ? okay ! '' then i go over there .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16784 4:39 |that was - that was a critical factor in making my job more effective .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16785 4:51 |getting involved with the industry , it 's really easy to get lost .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16786 4:56 |it 's easy to lose focus , especially when you 're distracted by the glamour . being a make up artist is n't always glamorous .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16787 5:08 |it 's hard work . you really need to have your head on straight .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16788 5:11 |make sure to make the right decisions .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16789 5:15 |there will be situations that you 're involved with where you might feel uneasy , where something 's not right .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16790 5:20 |when i first started , i was a people pleaser . i really wanted to do the best job possible .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16791 5:25 |i thought i was n't allowed to say no . i soon found myself in situations , jobs where i had no idea what i was doing .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16792 5:38 |that 's why i went back to school to learn special effects . that was a big lesson learned !| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16793 5:47 |prosthetics ... is a whole different ball of wax ! seriously .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16794 5:56 |makeup , itself , is an art .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16795 5:59 |you have to learn how to create a canvas using the person 's face .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16796 6:05 |then you paint the picture . strike a balance . you have to check the camera often because sometimes you see something| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16797 6:16 |on the screen - `` wait a minute '' - and you have to check it in person . sometimes you ca n't tell on the screen . `` where ? ''| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16798 6:23 |this happens all the time . special effects is really hard . you work with fake blood .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16799 6:26 |you have to make sure that , um , you pick the right kind of blood . for example , there might be a scene where a person is| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16800 6:38 |wearing an expensive dress made by a celebrity designer . and then the person gets stabbed . you have to make sure that the| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16801 6:47 |blood does n't stain the clothes . if that happens , the company gets stuck having to pay for the dress . they ca n't return it .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16802 6:56 |well , that . it 's very detailed .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16803 7:02 |initially , i was hired to do touch up , just some light makeup work , nothing fancy . it was a pbs documentary special .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16804 7:14 |jodie foster was the host . she was interviewing people involved with creating and building the walt disney concert| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16805 7:28 |hall . we went in a week before the grand opening . she interviewed many people including frank gehry , a famous| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16806 7:39 |architect who designed the fancy wall and the building , yo yo ma , a famous cellist , and of course , josh groban . my job was| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16807 7:53 |to make sure that they were n't sweating and no hair was out of place . it was my job to make sure everything was perfect| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16808 8:01 |for the interview . i worked for about a week . at the end of the shooting , one of the production coordinators for the| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16809 8:11 |grand opening , that weekend , came up to me and said : `` we need a make up artist to do the event . '' `` oh , okay ! '' we discussed and| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16810 8:23 |negotiated on rates , times . so , i got the job ! the following night at the grand opening , i had no idea who i was going to| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16811 8:38 |work on , where i had to go . i brought my makeup kits with me to the basement . there was a long hallway with a bunch| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16812 8:48 |of doors . that was where the special guests were . i went into the first door . and , wow ! it was tom hanks .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16813 9:05 |steven spielberg ! i was in awe . i have to admit i was a bit star-struck . i thought to myself , `` okay , keep your cool . ''| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16814 9:15 |`` keep your cool . '' i just went to work .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16815 9:19 |all of the people i worked on that night were amazing . nice people !| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16816 9:26 |to be part of something that big , the grand opening of the walt disney concert hall , that was ... wow !| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16817 9:37 |the event was live , it was filmed live .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16818 9:41 |but their cameras - back then - i 'm going to go back a bit .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16819 9:44 |back then we did n't have high definition ( hd ) . hd is a different type of animal . you 've to really make sure everything| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16820 9:54 |is precise and exact . back in the 80s , you could have wide eyes , dark and dramatic makeup . you could n't notice the flaws .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16821 10:05 |however , with hd , you can notice every little detail . the event took place on a stage . because it was live , everything| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16822 10:18 |had to be perfectly coordinated before they walk onstage . there were about three or four different cameras so you ca n't| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16823 10:29 |just stop in the middle of it , run up , and do some touch up . there was a live audience and it was a televised event so you| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16824 10:37 |had to be careful . one woman - and i wo n't say who - she had the most beautiful dress . her makeup , for some reason , did n't| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16825 10:52 |match the dress . her personal makeup artist could n't come with her backstage before the performance . when she came out ,| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16826 10:59 |the person who was in charge of the cameras noticed and told her that her makeup had to be changed . she had to be on stage| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16827 11:06 |in two minutes . i was all `` what ? '' but it was okay . i had to do it . i went up . it was very challenging . she was very| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16828 11:15 |resistant to letting me touch her face . i had to explain to her that if she went up on stage , the blue on her face would| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16829 11:20 |really pop . it would n't look good . it 's hd . she finally allowed me to change her makeup .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16830 11:30 |i was relieved .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16831 11:31 |i got it done in the nick of time . she went on stage ... and she looked great !| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16832 11:40 |and i never got a thank you for it but whatever . that 's show biz .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16833 11:46 |my favorite is turning a young person into an old person . it 's a lot of fun . fun ! fun . many of the actors do n't like it| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16834 11:58 |because they do n't want to see themselves aged 50 years . but like i said , it 's fun ! just creating wrinkles and using| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16835 12:08 |latex . latex is n't very pliable so you really have to work fast . you have to be careful because it has one of the| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16836 12:19 |ingredients a lot of people are allergic to . you always have to test before the actual shooting . it 's always difficult to| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16837 12:29 |tie down some time with the talent . old age - it requires a lot of latex . sometimes i add prosthetics . usually when a| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16838 12:41 |person becomes older , the nose continues to grow . you ca n't make a young person look older without the nose . and the| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16839 12:52 |chin . and the hair . it 's fun to play with ! it gets stressful when there 's a time constraint .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16840 13:02 |many times , while working on set , there are delays because we do n't usually finish on time .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16841 13:15 |always smile . never complain .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16842 13:18 |ask for help . if you need help , i 'm here .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16843 13:25 |make sure that you 're always on time .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16844 13:31 |be honest .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16845 13:33 |make sure you never underbid your fellow makeup artists .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16846 13:38 |you need to do your job right . make sure you 're on time . if they give you a 9:30 call time , show up at 8:30 .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16847 13:49 |give yourself some preparation . know your craft . practice as much as you can . go to classes and seminars . talk with other| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16848 14:01 |makeup artists and get feedback . always try to get involved with different things . do n't focus on just movies . or just| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16849 14:12 |commercials . or just photography . try to branch out . doing that will give you the tools you need for your future jobs .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16850 14:24 |integrity . be sure to be honest about your bid . if you know that your friends or other makeup artists that want the job| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16851 14:31 |and have already bid , do n't bid . leave it for them . it 's their job . do n't try to underbid . it 's not fair .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16852 14:39 |you do n't want that to happen to you so do n't do it .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16853 14:42 |make sure you have open communication with the director , or first a.d .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16854 14:48 |make sure you are friendly toward the talents even if they are miserable or terrible . just smile and suck it up .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16855 14:58 |hopefully i 'll be working with you in the future .| b7GFqedkUl4
_*16856 15:00 |oh , and always make sure you wash your hands before you touch a person 's face !| b7GFqedkUl4

_*17329 1:38 |miss , have you ever seen anybody who has got aids ?| DmiO-LOApNA
_*17330 1:43 |why do you ask that question ?| DmiO-LOApNA
_*17331 1:45 |because some people say they do n't believe in aids ,| DmiO-LOApNA
_*17332 1:47 |because they 've never seen anyone who has aids .| DmiO-LOApNA
_*17333 1:51 |as you 're all aware , the only way of finding out| DmiO-LOApNA
_*17334 1:54 |if a person is infected with the virus that causes aids| DmiO-LOApNA
_*17335 1:58 |is for them to take an hiv test .| DmiO-LOApNA
_*17336 2:01 |that said , i personally have known people who have hiv ,| DmiO-LOApNA
_*17337 2:05 |and they live with hiv .| DmiO-LOApNA

_*17343 2:35 |she and i spend a lot of time together .| DmiO-LOApNA
_*17344 2:44 |i did n't really understand when you said that all of us knew a person living with hiv .| DmiO-LOApNA
_*17345 2:49 |sali , i think i know you well enough to know that i can count on your discretion .| DmiO-LOApNA

_*17351 3:21 |modern medicines which can slow down the illness 's progress .| DmiO-LOApNA
_*17352 3:25 |they would have helped my husband live longer .| DmiO-LOApNA
_*17353 3:29 |but they were too expensive ; we did n't have the money .| DmiO-LOApNA
_*17354 3:35 |and my husband died .| DmiO-LOApNA
_*17355 3:38 |yes , you already know somebody living with hiv .| DmiO-LOApNA

_*17383 6:23 |to be healthier and live longer , even if there is no cure yet .| DmiO-LOApNA

_*18234 4:45 |jesus i am yours| Ia6evaf9XJ0
_*18235 0:00 |when i wonder how i became a teacher , what motivates my teaching , what inspires my teaching , i look back| oRll-337k8c
_*18236 0:06 |and remember junior nad at school . they had a project called `` big brothers , big sisters '' .| oRll-337k8c
_*18237 0:12 |i joined with enthusiasm , and we had a small group discussing and deciding how to work with young| oRll-337k8c
_*18238 0:18 |children as role models . i said sure , and went to observe young children .| oRll-337k8c
_*18239 0:24 |there was one , a cute little black boy . he was alone . i wanted to meet him . he was around 3 to 4 years old .| oRll-337k8c
_*18240 0:30 |i said `` hello ! what 's your name ? '' he looked all around , but did n't look at me . i studied him , went around him ,| oRll-337k8c
_*18241 0:36 |trying to say hello . he continued to refuse to look at me . i gave up and went ahead and told a story about pushing| oRll-337k8c
_*18242 0:42 |a stick along the sidewalk , seeing ants in the grass . look at that , it means a long winter .| oRll-337k8c
_*18243 0:48 |he still did n't look at me . i went ahead anyway and narrated diferent things -- the| oRll-337k8c
_*18244 0:54 |trees , various comments . still did n't look at me . we walked together .| oRll-337k8c
_*18245 1:00 |but every so often , we would walk together , he would n't run off or wander , which was good .| oRll-337k8c
_*18246 1:06 |when the project finished , i was wondering what happened to that boy , but i did n't know .| oRll-337k8c
_*18247 1:12 |i grew up , and eventually i worked at that school . there was a basketball game on , and i was responsible| oRll-337k8c
_*18248 1:18 |for selling popcorn , candy and such . i got a tap on the shoulder , and i looked up at a tall boy .| oRll-337k8c
_*18249 1:24 |`` what ? '' i said , and he looked at me and said `` remember me ? '' i looked back , `` no , i do n't know who you are . ''| oRll-337k8c
_*18250 1:30 |he told me his name . i still did n't realize . `` i do n't remember your name . do n't know you , '' i said apologetically .| oRll-337k8c
_*18251 1:36 |`` remember you tend to like to tell stories ? when i was little , that was you , telling me stories all the time . ''| oRll-337k8c
_*18252 1:42 |i was startled . `` what ? ! that was a long time ago . i was in hs , and i thought you were n't looking at me . ''| oRll-337k8c
_*18253 1:48 |he said , `` yes , i was listening . these walks , wow , they saved my life . at home , i was lonely , suffering ,| oRll-337k8c
_*18254 1:54 |being beaten . whoa , you saved my life . i looked forward to you coming and walking with me . ''| oRll-337k8c
_*18255 2:00 |i listened with joy and said oh good , he 's married , he has children . wow , he has a great life now .| oRll-337k8c
_*18256 2:06 |he went away , and i thought , how important it is for teachers to know that , even when you think| oRll-337k8c
_*18257 2:12 |children are n't paying attention , they are really listening . keep on talking , go ahead and teach .| oRll-337k8c
_*18258 2:18 |tell stories regardless . that , i realized , really made a difference for one child .| oRll-337k8c
_*18259 2:24 |i 'm satisified with that .| oRll-337k8c
_*18260 0:00 |[ this video has no audio , in honor of 'no audio day ' ... ]| DErsGJU0KuU
_*18261 0:04 |[ ... and a good no audio day to you ! ]| DErsGJU0KuU
_*18262 0:07 |hello asl community !| DErsGJU0KuU
_*18263 0:08 |i usually post my vlogs on the 1st and 15th of each month ,| DErsGJU0KuU
_*18264 0:12 |but one viewer| DErsGJU0KuU
_*18265 0:14 |notified me of something ; when i looked into it ,| DErsGJU0KuU
_*18266 0:16 |i was so disturbed that i just had to let you know about it .| DErsGJU0KuU
_*18267 0:21 |if someone were to tell you that asl was n't a true language ,| DErsGJU0KuU
_*18268 0:24 |that it was all just a bunch of rudimentary| DErsGJU0KuU
_*18269 0:26 |miming and gesturing , how would you feel ?| DErsGJU0KuU
_*18270 0:29 |sad to say , that 's precisely what 's happening here in italy .| DErsGJU0KuU
_*18271 0:32 |for years now , the italian signing community ,| DErsGJU0KuU
_*18272 0:35 |comprised of both deaf and hearing signers ,| DErsGJU0KuU
_*18273 0:39 |have been striving to convince their government| DErsGJU0KuU
_*18274 0:42 |to recognize their signed language : lis .| DErsGJU0KuU
_*18275 0:46 |they 've submitted a document regarding lis to the government ,| DErsGJU0KuU
_*18276 0:50 |which the government is ready to officially recognize| DErsGJU0KuU
_*18277 0:53 |*however* they want to replace the acronym 'lis ' with 'lmg ' ,| DErsGJU0KuU
_*18278 0:57 |essentially meaning 'language of miming and gesturing '| DErsGJU0KuU
_*18279 1:03 |hey , i 've got an idea : maybe we should start referring to| DErsGJU0KuU
_*18280 1:07 |spoken italian as 'lmg ' - language of moans and grunts !| DErsGJU0KuU
_*18281 1:18 |if you 'd like more information , check out the links below .| DErsGJU0KuU

_*19171 0:04 |yup , i grew up in delaware .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19172 0:05 |you 're shocked ?| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19173 0:08 |i remember we talked about the movie , 'wayne 's world . '| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19174 0:11 |i remember when that came out ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19175 0:13 |i went with a friend to watch the movie . i loved 'saturday night live ' growing up .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19176 0:20 |we were watching it . they were doing a montage , and several shots passed , then stopped on one .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19177 0:27 |and they said , delaware . i 'm in delaware .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19178 0:32 |we put up with it . we were watching it in a theater in newark , delaware . that was a blow .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19179 0:39 |i knew that was a great way of knowing what to expect when i meet people all over the world .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19180 0:44 |i 'm being ironic . but yes .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19181 0:48 |i was born hearing . i had meningitis when i was a 13-month old baby .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19182 0:54 |from that point on , i was deaf .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19183 0:57 |my parents learned to sign to communicate with me .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19184 1:03 |by the time i was three , that was when i really learned to sign , speak and dance . all at once .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19185 1:12 |that was how i was progressing and growing .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19186 1:16 |i went to a deaf institute . i was mainstreamed . i did more mainstream than anything , actually .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19187 1:20 |i still had strong deaf community ties within myself .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19188 1:24 |so , i 'm grateful for my parents for making sure that was inherent in my life .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19189 1:29 |one of my best friends i had growing up attended mssd , on gallaudet campus .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19190 1:34 |i visited there and met people . it was the first time i met deaf role models . in the arts .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19191 1:41 |so , for a 15-year old mind , it just re-framed my mind for a bit .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19192 1:46 |yola royzneck , fred beam , mike lamitola , wawa -- warren snipes ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19193 1:54 |i had just realized that i was definitely on the right track .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19194 2:00 |'mother courage and her children ' was done here in new york city ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19195 2:04 |... in central park . every summer , they show 'shakespeare in the park . '| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19196 2:07 |they 've been showing two different productions through public theater .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19197 2:11 |meryl streep , kevin kline , jenifer lewis ... all just great actors .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19198 2:18 |my role in that was kattrin , the mute daughter .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19199 2:23 |in that experience , i finally felt validated as an actor .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19200 2:30 |i felt trapped and stuck with deaf roles . i never knew if i did well with it or whatever .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19201 2:35 |the public theater and the director looked at the character ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19202 2:40 |... and thought , 'we should cast a deaf person who can move well . '| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19203 2:44 |so they auditioned everyone .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19204 2:46 |it was really awesome auditioning , because i saw a lot of people i knew , some flew in from l.a ... .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19205 2:50 |... so it was like a reunion . naturally , it was stressful .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19206 2:53 |because we were all auditioning for the same role , so we were anxious .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19207 2:56 |then it was all over , and they decided to cast me ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19208 2:58 |... which i am thankful for . as i progressed into the project ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19209 3:01 |i realized that i , a deaf actor , was playing a hearing role , but with no ability to speak ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19210 3:08 |so , throughout the entire play i had to play it as if i could hear .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19211 3:14 |so you know what my secret was ? i memorized the entire play .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19212 3:17 |it 's a three-hour play . memorized the entire thing .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19213 3:21 |so i could play off the lines being said by others , mellow-like and casual .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19214 3:25 |it was a huge feat . but those are the type of challenges that i just take on by storm .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19215 3:31 |i take on all other challenges too , but this was one of the biggest ones i 've ever had .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19216 3:35 |what truly inspired me about this was ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19217 3:37 |the audience -- 750 seats , i think it was a 2-3 week run --| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19218 3:43 |it was sold out pretty much all the way throughout --| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19219 3:46 |i 'd say about three-quarters of the audience who watched had absolutely no idea i was deaf .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19220 3:53 |so i felt i was finally viewed as an actor .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19221 3:57 |it had nothing to do with my hearing or anything at all . i felt liberated by it .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19222 4:02 |okay .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19223 4:07 |'nurse jackie . ' again , another one that my agent sent me to .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19224 4:11 |so i went in , communicated with them , immediately after ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19225 4:15 |with the director -- the casting director actually -- we immediately connected .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19226 4:20 |i think it 's much to do with the rapport and chemistry you have with them , regardless if you 're deaf or hearing ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19227 4:27 |it 's how you connect with them , and how you show yourself . if they like it , what are you gon na do ?| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19228 4:31 |just go with it .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19229 4:33 |i love the difference between the stage , film and television , because ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19230 4:37 |... it 's a different type of acting . i want to see how it stretches .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19231 4:42 |how does the signer express her/himself ? through facial expressions , mood and signing ?| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19232 4:48 |how do you know if it 's enough ? ideal ? or over the top ?| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19233 4:52 |how do we learn that ? we never have opportunities to practice this .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19234 4:56 |how do other people accept signing and the actors themselves if they do n't see enough of them ?| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19235 5:04 |it 's the same thing . a lot of the ideals of signing is to make the signs smaller ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19236 5:08 |... or to keep standing and signing like a stiff wooden board . there 's no freedom .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19237 5:13 |i ca n't just lay down sideways and sign , or sign from above looking down ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19238 5:17 |i want those ideas to challenge more .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19239 5:20 |i think that the more people see how three-dimensional ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19240 5:23 |... this language is , our bodies , the way we communicate ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19241 5:27 |they 'll see it 's really rich .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19242 5:31 |i think , most importantly , if you get hired ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19243 5:34 |... it 's because they saw something in you .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19244 5:37 |bring that to the set .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19245 5:41 |be yourself , yes , but know you 're there for the job .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19246 5:44 |you know ? it depends on your personality , i ca n't speak for everyone , but ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19247 5:50 |i 'm a very focused person , and i focus on doing my job .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19248 5:54 |i communicate with people when we 're allowed , and then when it 's time to work , i stay on task .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19249 6:00 |be alert , be aware of your surroundings ... and choose your battles .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19250 6:07 |there was a time when there was no interpreter for me on set , and i thought to myself ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19251 6:13 |should i object to this ? should i complain ?| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19252 6:17 |if i did indeed complain , that would mean they would have to ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19253 6:20 |... make a decision and decide the consequences thereafter .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19254 6:23 |is that more important to me now ? or is this about me being the center of attention ?| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19255 6:30 |or is it about my presence , because if i can be there to teach ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19256 6:36 |... or share an experience , a positive , constructive experience ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19257 6:41 |... that opens -- this is crucial -- opens the minds of these people ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19258 6:47 |... which means 20-30 deaf people would have opportunities as a result .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19259 6:56 |if i was close-minded , fought , rebelled and shouted complaints against them ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19260 7:00 |then that would mean closed doors and windows for the rest of them .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19261 7:04 |so i feel that the act of diplomacy is crucial .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19262 7:10 |some of you may feel like it 's not your job to do so , which may be true ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19263 7:14 |... but it is a responsibility .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19264 7:16 |i 've made the choices i 've made , because i know the big picture is much more important than me .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19265 7:21 |at that moment . i just accept it .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19266 7:26 |step out of the box . this industry is all about taking risks .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19267 7:34 |and they do it all the time .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19268 7:36 |and when the attention turns to deaf people all of a sudden there 's this nervous energy .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19269 7:40 |so , i think that if people decide to embrace that ... fear , maybe ?| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19270 7:48 |look at it and ask , 'what is it ? is it the concern of how they 'd communicate on set ? '| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19271 7:54 |go online and find out .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19272 7:55 |learn how they communicate on set . learn american sign basics ? hire somebody ?| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19273 8:01 |maybe it 'd cost too much ? strike that . you want that particular actor ... so arrange to meet her/him .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19274 8:07 |write on paper , use text message , e-mail , phone , whatever it takes ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19275 8:12 |use some form of communication . you 've got technology now . take advantage of it .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19276 8:17 |you 're not locked to your ears and your voice . you 've got eyes , and you can use your hands .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19277 8:24 |if you see a character that is n't deaf , but know a deaf actor that is fitting for it ... why not ?| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19278 8:33 |if the character has lines ... that 's fine .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19279 8:38 |it does n't always have to be about the deafness .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19280 8:41 |it 's not .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19281 8:43 |that 's one thing that i feel that often happens ; it always has to be central to the plot ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19282 8:48 |the deaf person , the romance , the villain ... there has to be a reason , a backstory ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19283 8:55 |if it 's good to have that , sure . but if you had a random deaf person pop up in it , it 's fine , too .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19284 9:02 |our lives , we live in a world like this .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19285 9:04 |how often do you go to the subway , restaurant , library , bookstore or ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19286 9:09 |... or radio shack or any type of store , or a park , and you see ...| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19287 9:16 |... people and you classify them as deaf or hearing ? their abilities ? you do n't . you just see people , right ?| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19288 9:25 |then when you do see sign language , you find it intriguing to look at .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19289 9:28 |that 's real life .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19290 9:29 |makes you wonder if you should incorporate more real life onto the stage or on the screen .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19291 9:45 |keep going . this is not about instant gratification .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19292 9:49 |just know who you are , and if you feel the need to express yourself , you 're doing the right thing .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19293 9:53 |just move forward , and at the same time be mindful that people are watching you .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19294 10:01 |they are watching your communication , your diplomacy , your relationships . it 's part of the territory .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19295 10:08 |that may be a pro or a con , but that 's simply reality .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19296 10:11 |if you 're feeling stuck and you have no one to reach out to , go to the dwif website .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19297 10:18 |they have a great list of links to visit . you can find your local community there .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19298 10:22 |you 've got l.a. , or canada even . there 's different areas .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19299 10:27 |use technology . it 's your advantage now .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19300 10:31 |this is the golden era for that . seize the opportunity .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19301 10:35 |but , more than anything , if you 've got something inside of you wanting to get out , do it .| RkOfKMz_XoM
_*19302 10:40 |you have a lot of people out there who are willing to support you .| RkOfKMz_XoM

_*19309 0:19 |just because people can understand you| JNbY10uOCjI
_*19310 0:21 |this is what some members of the deaf community had to deal with in the past| JNbY10uOCjI

_*19934 2:08 |and share any information that could be relevant for example| PxarNx4eyQ0
_*19935 2:16 |something subtle seen in a speech session could enable an audiologist to| PxarNx4eyQ0
_*19936 2:21 detect PxarNx4eyQ0
_*19937 2:21 |a progressive loss the role the parent of a child with hearing loss can be| PxarNx4eyQ0
_*19938 2:28 daunting PxarNx4eyQ0
_*19939 2:28 |but many resources are available various resources are available through schools| PxarNx4eyQ0
_*19940 2:33 |and audiology clinics online resources are also available| PxarNx4eyQ0
_*19941 0:08 |i believe that every child can learn , even if they come with multiple disabilities with| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19942 0:14 |that deafness , or they come and they are just deaf . but i think they all can learn , somehow ,| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19943 0:22 |some way . so we work hard to try to make that happen .| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19944 0:26 |why do you think that granddad wanted to walk to a high hill ?| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19945 0:33 |why not low hill ?| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19946 0:41 |because the high hill we can stand and see everything below . if it 's a low hill ,| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19947 0:47 |you wo n't be able to see because of the trees and everything . so ,| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19948 0:55 |my favorite , it 's best| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19949 1:03 |good !| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19950 1:06 |the beautiful trees , we walk for a long time .| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19951 1:10 |very good !| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19952 1:12 |i wish that all teachers knew that deaf students are very capable . and just to hold them to| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19953 1:19 |the same expectations as they would any child .| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19954 1:22 |okay , and how about over here ? who wants to share ?| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19955 1:31 |i think he 's in the middle of nowhere and he 's just having dreams .| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19956 1:35 |any particular dreams ?| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19957 1:51 |maybe he 's in like a boat or something , and he gets shot out of it and into a tree .| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19958 1:57 |and he wakes up and sees where he is , he looks around , does n't know where he is .| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19959 2:01 |alright , let 's , okay , let 's see .| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19960 2:02 |treat them just like any other child ; if they 're not paying attention , if they 're not doing| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19961 2:07 |what they 're supposed to do , you know , the teacher needs to treat them just like everybody| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19962 2:12 |else . sometimes i think people think `` oh , it 's the poor deaf child '' and they tend| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19963 2:16 |to give them a lot more room when it comes to discipline and stuff a lot of times . and| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19964 2:21 |also academically . most of the children , not all , but a lot of the children here have pretty| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19965 2:29 |good language and are doing very well in the classroom . just , you know , try to remember| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19966 2:35 |to treat them the same you would any other child as far as what you expect from them| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19967 2:41 |academically ; homework , reading , their math , anything else with the other classes .| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19968 2:46 |the most important thing is to have high expectations for the deaf students . although deaf students| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19969 2:52 |are extremely individual in terms of the previous background that they 've had , whether or| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19970 2:57 |not they 've had any type of early intervention , does the child come from a home in which the| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19971 3:02 |parents know signing , if they 've selected signing for the child , does the child come| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19972 3:07 |from a background where english is not the child 's home language . so there are many| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19973 3:12 |different factors that are involved in thinking about what 's appropriate for a deaf student .| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19974 3:18 |the family , of course , is the biggest determiner of that , in terms of mode of communication ,| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19975 3:23 |and family support . but i would say generally for a regular classroom teacher to have high| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19976 3:27 |expectations of a deaf student . but realize that deaf students enter schooling with different| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19977 3:35 |types of knowledge , different types of experiences .| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19978 3:38 |i think the regular classroom teacher , in order to educate the deaf student , really| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19979 3:44 |needs to know about that student , just like she would the hearing students in the classroom ,| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19980 3:50 |and get to know the background of the student , because that plays an important role when| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19981 3:55 |the child comes in day after day . i also think it 's important for them to learn about deaf| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19982 4:01 |culture , and what that brings with the child , as well as deafness itself . you know , how| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19983 4:10 |greatly deafness impacts the language with the deaf child . the regular teacher needs| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19984 4:17 |to learn about the mode of communication that the child may use . some of our students use| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19985 4:23 |american sign language , some of our students it 's more pidgin , but it would be important| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19986 4:28 |for them to understand that there is a difference .| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19987 4:31 |i would probably advise a regular classroom teacher to consult with the teacher of the| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19988 4:36 |deaf , who probably has the primary information about the student . i do think that it 's| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19989 4:41 |very important that the regular classroom teacher knows , what are the child 's interests ?| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19990 4:46 |is the child interested in sports , what types of activities does the family do , because| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19991 4:51 |that way , you could make some real life connections and lessons to what the child is interested| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19992 4:57 |in , and therefore , it 's going , the information , the heavy academic information is going to| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19993 5:01 |be more accessible to them , and more relatable to them .| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19994 5:05 |when i 've taken sign language classes a lot , one of the first things they did was| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19995 5:09 |kind of to dispel a lot of the rumors people think about deaf people , you know , that deaf| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19996 5:14 |people ca n't drive , they read braille , or they think , you know , there 's just a lot| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19997 5:18 |of silly little things that often times people do n't know or do n't realize .| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19998 5:22 |i had one regular ed teacher who did share that , you know , she did n't realize how often| QniyT6dEYPo
_*19999 5:36 |`` that 's good to know , '' because then if we do have a teacher who has never had| QniyT6dEYPo
_*20000 5:40 |a deaf child , it 's good to let them know , `` well , they might make these little noises| QniyT6dEYPo
_*20001 5:45 |because , you know , they 're not totally silent . ''| QniyT6dEYPo
_*20002 5:49 |ask ryan .| QniyT6dEYPo
_*20003 5:57 |we do a lot of teaching the pragmatics of language , you know , what 's appropriate to| QniyT6dEYPo
_*20004 6:03 |say , what 's not appropriate responses you give to people for questions they might ask .| QniyT6dEYPo
_*20005 6:10 |we do lots of role-playing and try to work on the social skills , because they have to| QniyT6dEYPo
_*20006 6:16 |be taught . some of the other factors are really learning the child as an individual . some| QniyT6dEYPo
_*20007 6:23 |of our children need just a little bit , some of our children have greater needs . and that ,| QniyT6dEYPo
_*20008 6:29 |you know , the regular ed teacher knows what those are and is sensitive to that . and some| QniyT6dEYPo
_*20009 6:37 |of it we learn by doing . some of the grades they may play a variety of games to learn| QniyT6dEYPo
_*20010 6:45 |concepts , like jeopardy and things like that , so we 've learned that in order for the deaf| QniyT6dEYPo
_*20011 6:52 |student to be successful and to participate , you 've got to give the lag time , because| QniyT6dEYPo
_*20012 6:57 |the interpreter has to sign some things , and so we change how you might play the game ,| QniyT6dEYPo
_*20013 7:05 |or we , the teacher might have to count to three before anyone can push the buzzer . so ,| QniyT6dEYPo
_*20014 7:10 |you know , i find the willingness of a teacher to make those changes , to accommodate , that| QniyT6dEYPo
_*20015 7:18 |i have a child that has special needs in the classroom . that is just a great thing .| QniyT6dEYPo

_*20022 0:00 |ok , this vlog is for explaining how i decided to learn sign and my subsequent `` journey '' through the deaf world and how i got involved| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20023 0:16 |i 'm gon na try to make this short . `` american horror story '' is on soon !| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20024 0:27 |i love that show ! ! !| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20025 0:30 |alright , let 's make this quick ! !| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20026 0:35 |now i 'm 20 years old .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20027 0:40 |ok , so early last year ...| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20028 0:46 |i decided i want to learn sign language .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20029 0:51 |why ? ? lots and lots of reasons : p| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20030 0:54 |but i 'm going to try to list the few most important reasons .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20031 1:00 |first reason : i 'm hard of hearing : p| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20032 1:05 |that 's the most important reason i decided to learn sign !| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20033 1:13 |because i 'm hard of hearing , socializing made it really frustrating to try to understand everyone .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20034 1:34 |especially if a room has lots of background noise , i have a lot of trouble trying to understand everyone speaking at once .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20035 1:43 |it just got to the point where i had to `` nod my way through , '' pretending that i understood people .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20036 1:49 |in reality , though , i had no idea what was going on !| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20037 1:53 |so , being hard of hearing was one reason ...| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20038 1:58 |and the other reason ? it just made sense ...| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20039 2:02 |if i 'm hard of hearing , why always try to listen with my imperfect ears if i ca n't hear ? ? ? why ? ?| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20040 2:13 |makes no sense ...| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20041 2:15 |because asl is a visual language , it 's a lot better for me .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20042 2:21 |( ok so hard of hearing , makes sense ... )| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20043 2:29 |i just read a lot of books about asl .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20044 2:34 |my high school offered a wide variety of classes .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20045 2:40 |i took a basic anthropology class the fall semester of my senior year of high school .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20046 2:51 |in that class we had to read a book- oh , sorry , low battery ...| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20047 3:01 |anyway , so the book was called `` next of kin . ''| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20048 3:11 |it 's about scientists teaching chimps sign .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20049 3:16 |in that book , it had lots of background information about sign language that i found really interesting .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20050 3:29 |i really fell in love with that book .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20051 3:35 |it was a page-turner !| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20052 3:41 |i became immersed -- is this the right sign for immersed ? ? i 'll look that up when i finish this vlog ...| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20053 3:57 |ok , well , anyway , that 's the third reason i decided to learn sign ... along with a little tv show called `` switched at birth . '' i do n't know if you 've heard of it ; p| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20054 4:11 |i 'm one of those other hearing girls whose decision to learn asl was also because of that show ...| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20055 4:19 |( ok , hard of hearing , makes sense ... reading ... )| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20056 4:25 |... yeah ... those are the three major reasons i decided to learn asl .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20057 4:34 |ok , so when i decided i wanted to take an asl class , i was also taking a writing class at my school , stony brook university .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20058 4:49 |at the end of the semester , everyone had to submit a research paper .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20059 4:59 |and , so i chose to write about why parents should teach their deaf children to sign .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20060 5:16 |i had to do a lot of extensive research for that paper , and i looked at so many websites for that topic . i learned a lot .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20061 5:28 |checking the time ... .ok ! i have enough time ! : )| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20062 5:33 |ok , after i submitted the paper , i was fully convinced that learning sign was the perfect decision . just a wonderful decision .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20063 5:50 |ok , so that summer , i took an asl class .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20064 5:58 |and ... wow ... i fell in love with asl from there !| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20065 6:07 |when i woke up everyday- no , every monday and wednesday , or for asl 2 , every tuesday and thursday ... ? i do n't know .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20066 6:22 |ok , so monday and wednesday for asl 1 and tuesday and thursday for asl 2 ...| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20067 6:30 |when i woke up in the morning for class , i was excited and happy !| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20068 6:37 |when i woke up on days i did n't have class , i was very sad : (| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20069 6:47 |i picked it up fast .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20070 6:52 |i was a good student . i did the homework , signed really well , played around with my facial expressions ...| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20071 7:02 |i loved learning sign .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20072 7:06 |ok , well , i loved learning it so much that i decided i needed more practice ...| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20073 7:19 |i do n't know any deaf people in my area , so i decided to look online for people to skype with .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20074 7:29 |i wanted to skype with a more experienced signer , so i took that into account when i looked around for people to practice with .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20075 7:39 |so , then i finally found someone . he was a guy around my age .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20076 7:51 |he went to college at rit . and he was deaf !| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20077 8:03 |i was really excited to find someone to practice with !| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20078 8:09 |so , then we skyped every night . it was really exciting for me . i got the chance to practice !| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20079 8:24 |then , i friended him on facebook . we ended up messaging each other a lot every day .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20080 8:42 |and so one day , he decided to visit me at my school , stony brook university .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20081 8:54 |i went along with it .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20082 9:00 |then , after the first week of school , he came for labor day weekend .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20083 9:15 |that night , i told him i loved him .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20084 9:21 |he told me he loved me back .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20085 9:25 |the next day , i asked him to be my boyfriend . he said , `` ok , sure . ''| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20086 9:35 |we entered a relationship after that .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20087 9:42 |he visited me a lot .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20088 9:47 |then , at the end of september i visited him at rit .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20089 9:54 |wow . it was a unique experience !| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20090 10:03 |i met so many of his deaf friends and got to talk with them .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20091 10:10 |i could n't believe so many hearing people there knew asl !| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20092 10:16 |i wish sbu could be like that !| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20093 10:26 |yeah , so that was my big introduction to deaf culture .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20094 10:33 |i went to a deaf party . it was such a different experience from hearing parties !| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20095 10:46 |yeah ... .i do n't really want to go into detail about our relationship ... long story short , we broke up .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20096 11:00 |on our one year anniversary !| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20097 11:06 |we had lots of issues ... i do n't want to talk about them ...| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20098 11:13 |but i will say this ... even though i 'm happy we broke up , i 'm grateful for the experience i gained . he taught me a lot .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20099 11:31 |ok , well , we broke up around two and a half months ago and since then , i have n't really gotten the chance to socialize with other deaf people .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20100 11:52 |that makes me sad .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20101 11:57 |i 've really picked up sign fast , but i 'd hate to see my skills regress .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20102 12:10 |there are no deaf people here . that 's why i 'm making this vlog .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20103 12:17 |i 've been watching asl videos online and making sure i understand them .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20104 12:25 |but , i 'm really sad i do n't have any deaf friends : c| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20105 12:32 |i have a dream of when i 'm at grad school in seattle or some place , i 'll have lots of chances to socialize with other deaf people . i 'll be happier .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20106 12:48 |then , my dream ends and i 'm back in an empty reality ...| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20107 12:59 |it 's funny ... when i 'm socializing with hearing people , everyone 's talking over each other and i 'm becoming exhausted with making an effort to understand people| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20108 13:21 |and then i imagine talking in a beautiful , articulate sign language with deaf people and actually understanding what people are saying .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20109 13:41 |then , i 'm jarred back into reality where i have to struggle to understand one word .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20110 13:47 |on the other hand , when i 'm with deaf people , it does get exhausting trying to decode everything in my non-native language .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20111 13:58 |also , i ca n't really express myself that well in an asl conversation , so i get discouraged from my imperfect signing .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20112 14:06 |and then i start to imagine being with hearing people and playing with words and articulating well in such flowery language and understanding what others are saying perfectly .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20113 14:21 |then i 'm back in reality again , babbling like a baby . vomiting out words .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20114 14:29 |now , i 'm stuck somewhere in between the deaf world and the hearing world .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20115 14:39 |i wish i could easily flow from one world to the next , instead of being stuck on a fence , not belonging to either world .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20116 14:47 |in the future , though , i know that i 'll be able to transition easily .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20117 14:56 |i 'm almost at that point , but still not quite there .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20118 15:04 |i think that 's it for this vlog . i 'll post a lot more , as many as i wish .| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20119 15:17 |yup . this is my socialization ; )| 4KIrVLYp9Y0
_*20120 15:22 |thanks for watching !| 4KIrVLYp9Y0

_*20294 3:10 |any other being course in a foreign language but| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20295 3:13 |something happen that i did n't expect i end up taking away much more from this| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20296 3:18 course Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20297 3:18 |just understanding and grammar and vocabulary and this is why i share with| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20298 3:22 you Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20299 3:23 |the first thing i notice is that i became very aware my ears| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20300 3:27 |i begin to appreciate my fans appearing| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20301 3:30 |many people would say within a| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20302 3:33 |miss most about losing their hearing is music but i think i miss| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20303 3:38 |a lot more than just the sound of music tear drop something| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20304 3:42 |like a porter or pencil even know you dropped it except| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20305 3:46 |you heard it hit the ground what happens happens with your dad you 're listening| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20306 3:53 |to the sound of your breeding| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20307 3:54 |where the sound of your eating what about this on your skin makes when you| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20308 4:01 |rub your hands together| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20309 4:02 |all these things make unique sound| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20310 4:06 |but i began to notice more after i started taking sign language| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20311 4:10 |as hearing individuals we should appreciate the wonders a very| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20312 4:14 |matter how many the sensation may seem already get| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20313 4:19 |who cares about the sounders game makes or| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20314 4:22 |that pencil i well| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20315 4:25 |let me give you an example you might find little more substantial| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20316 4:29 |thing about the way we communicate with each other hearing tend to be very| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20317 4:33 dismissive Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20318 4:34 |distracted by the world around us avoiding eye contact just| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20319 4:37 |calling on a conversation with our years your death this is not possible| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20320 4:42 |if you are looking at the person you 're signing with there 's no communication| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20321 4:46 |every second you look way you miss the important aspect of your conversation| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20322 4:49 |this makes communication more intimate and deeper connections are made| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20323 4:53 |you start to forget this distractions like just| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20324 4:57 |focus on another individual to the hearing| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20325 5:01 |communications become the thing that we are they even think about anymore| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20326 5:05 |we can communicate with almost everyone but| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20327 5:08 |row not communicate with them| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20328 5:13 |this is not the case here not everyone can sign in| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20329 5:16 |lip reading is really hard deaf people cherish communication we have this| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20330 5:21 |humans are social animals we want to communicate desire to be understood| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20331 5:26 |i think we sometimes repute even a personal interaction| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20332 5:30 |by and mike forced you to become a wonder to me i start to think about| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20333 5:34 everything Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20334 5:34 |relationship hearing i was excited about this| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20335 5:38 |newfound appreciation my hearing and at same time quite satisfied with that| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20336 5:42 |experience i have a lasting weeks my teacher encouraged those few| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20337 5:46 |want to continue their study assigned to take another eight weeks for the| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20338 5:50 |beginning course will| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20339 5:51 |before moving up to the intermediate on next class started same time same place| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20340 5:55 |next week| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20341 5:57 |weaving class that i i really had no intention to continue my city of sin| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20342 6:03 |but sure enough i found myself back next week for| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20343 6:06 |another a beating course asl| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20344 6:09 |and this is when i really started to study the language| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20345 6:13 |and by this i do n't mean memorizing vocabulary| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20346 6:17 |citing the started to make anthony my very first ever sign| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20347 6:21 |language class we learned a when you ask questions drivers ed| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20348 6:24 |engaged when you ask wh questions you or i presently ford| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20349 6:28 |when you ask yes no questions you raise your eyebrows| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20350 6:32 |first time round glass this she was very forced| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20351 6:36 |i want free trade my brother more marathoners must be raised| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20352 6:40 |the second time around a class pay much more natural| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20353 6:44 |i realize this is normally what i do when i 'm with questions| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20354 6:47 |just as chris walters said earlier in the first session| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20355 6:51 |he could understand what his doctor saying even know| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20356 6:55 |brb you can understand if his doctors asking a question you know you can hear| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20357 7:00 |we all use peace gestures we all understand the social cues| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20358 7:04 |this allowed me to relax a little bit when learning sign language| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20359 7:07 |i realize it was n't so far on my own i became| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20360 7:11 |more comfortable with language| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20361 7:14 |and was able to appreciate the nuances of it| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20362 7:17 |asl is n't just the language it is art| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20363 7:21 |i means in two ways first| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20364 7:25 |and sells the alternate form expression its language meant winds are buying your| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20365 7:30 emotions Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20366 7:31 |our hands in our bodies great the words while fisher| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20367 7:34 |facial expressions are posture inflection| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20368 7:38 |without emotions said this is a kumquat begin monotone| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20369 7:42 |while the same a sign language you tell them you 're happy| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20370 7:46 |you have to look happy| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20371 7:49 |you 're gon na be guarding preserving our emotions from merkel 's from the family| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20372 7:53 |filing which forces you to be emotionally open and available want to| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20373 7:56 |express our thoughts and feelings and what| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20374 7:59 |while our feelings made easy to express mi amor process we convey clearly| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20375 8:04 |the same become complicated sign language i can find exact it is sick but| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20376 8:08 |my teacher something long lines have| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20377 8:10 |all the words in the english language only about a tenth of them are signs an| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20378 8:13 |ass out| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20379 8:14 |not only this but there are many words that share signs| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20380 8:17 |perhaps i have a very similar to urs my favorite example this is the number 99| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20381 8:22 |and the words french fries in situations like this| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20382 8:26 |everything depends on context and that 's the second reason and cells are| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20383 8:31 |it has to be interpreted anyone could look at a famous piece of artwork such| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20384 8:36 as Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20385 8:36 |edvard means paying popularly known as the screen and saying| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20386 8:41 |this person just saw spider that 's where they 're screaming| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20387 8:45 |well just because you come up with an interpretation| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20388 8:48 |does n't mean you pop artist me there are many ways but a single sentence could be| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20389 8:53 sacked Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20390 8:54 |and multiple ways to design centers can be translated to english| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20391 8:58 |is he having ninety about whether your interpretation offenders correct| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20392 9:02 |after missing the point my teachers are the best defense against this anxiety| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20393 9:06 |its community with those in about voice and sign in same time| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20394 9:10 |is the whole picture come together| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20395 9:13 |and the pictures coming together for me to i had gained an appreciation i 've| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20396 9:17 |been hearing| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20397 9:19 |and my starting to appreciate the language| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20398 9:23 |but i still did n't understand what it was like to be death| Z6srfOyIVpQ

_*20402 9:39 |taking forever and so you know everything about sign language| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20403 9:42 |because of this there is a very high level of ability among students in my| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20404 9:45 class Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20405 9:47 |classes start for salinas now and workers not to use our voices| Z6srfOyIVpQ

_*20431 11:34 |confused may be scared a| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20432 11:36 |for me he 's going to a time-limited| Z6srfOyIVpQ

_*20434 11:43 |10 back| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20435 11:45 |deaf people on the other hand can not escape here world| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20436 11:49 |because the hearing world is really wet there 's no doubt i 'll my teacher likes| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20437 11:52 |to say| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20438 11:54 |the hearing do n't have to interact with the deaf adapter consulates run about| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20439 11:57 |hearing people| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20440 11:58 |we do n't have to learn anything forget about deaf culture and will not| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20441 12:02 |if we do n't make an active effort you the dep on the other hand| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20442 12:05 |must learn from the hearing and must be part of your culture| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20443 12:09 |307 among the deaf toward the hearing this and the fact that many hearing| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20444 12:13 |people see themselves as superior to that| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20445 12:15 |was not an autism take for example what is| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20446 12:19 |often considered the politically correct way to death address that| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20447 12:23 |hearing-impaired is actually highly insulting| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20448 12:26 |in five a different pair inferior because they ca n't hear| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20449 12:30 |they could just as easily call us deputy care because we are def| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20450 12:34 |calling the deaf hearing impaired by their handicap need to be fixed| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20451 12:39 |differs with strongly disagree with this there 's actually an intense period of| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20452 12:42 pride Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20453 12:43 |community deaf people believe that deaf people should be in a relationship for| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20454 12:47 |the deaf people| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20455 12:49 |babies born de for desirable shares acne| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20456 12:53 |deficit is seen as a disability culture| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20457 12:57 |still in here in culture had ever seen as handicapped| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20458 13:01 |that 's why they tend to separate themselves as much as they can hearing| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20459 13:05 |so we need to evaluate have never treated in our culture and how we| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20460 13:09 personally Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20461 13:10 |at what you came up with an amazing example about sharing| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20462 13:14 |think a balmy nba players to be named| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20463 13:17 |think about how much their pay and how much air time ever seen it .| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20464 13:21 |now think i 've their wnba wnba players you can| Z6srfOyIVpQ

_*20467 13:34 |well they 're not even on the court the deaf and hard appears to look down upon| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20468 13:38 |our culture| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20469 13:39 |this road to get get jobs because the hearing do n't understand| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20470 13:43 |how to interact with others in the office the deaf and hard-of-hearing| Z6srfOyIVpQ

_*20473 13:51 |or politicians i just want to know the reason there 's not a picture a| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20474 13:55 |politician on the slide| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20475 13:56 |because there 's never been a good politician history yes government| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20476 14:01 |the deaf and hard-of-hearing should be able to follow their dreams just as the| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20477 14:03 |rest of us can| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20478 14:04 |but here is discrimination and lack of understanding deaf culture given away at| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20479 14:09 |so i challenge you with couple experiment my| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20480 14:12 |hope you understand just a little bit what it 's like to be done| Z6srfOyIVpQ

_*20485 14:28 |talk show morning news program or a doc| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20486 14:32 |you want to find something where the cameras continuously pointed at| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20487 14:35 |someone 's face you have a constant fear| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20488 14:38 |your tv or computer try to figure out what these people are saying| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20489 14:44 |just by reading their maps my teacher who 's been dec| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20490 14:47 |for over 20 years says she only thinks about 30 percent of people are saying| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20491 14:51 |when she read| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20492 14:54 |seven experiments for those who are a little more adventurous| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20493 14:58 |thought by some earplugs backfill come kind because they cancel at the last| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20494 15:01 night Z6srfOyIVpQ

_*20502 15:32 |a rather different a culture| Z6srfOyIVpQ
_*20503 15:35 |we should include the deaf and make them feel welcome we should treat them as we| Z6srfOyIVpQ

_*20735 1:05 |and the insulin to every cell in our body that needs it| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20736 1:09 |to make this easier to understand let 's look at muslims| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20737 1:14 |at the muscle cells insulin| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20738 1:17 |that allows the bouquets to get into the cells where it can be used for energy| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20739 1:21 |it 's a bit like insulin is a key unlocking the door to the cells| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20740 1:25 |so the clickers can get in that way| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20741 1:29 |the blood glucose level starts to drop but| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20742 1:32 |the blood glucose level can be topped up at any point by the liver| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20743 1:36 |releasing extra clear case that has stalled the blood glucose rises again| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20744 1:41 |and again the pancreas produces more insulin to move without glucose| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20745 1:46 |through the bloodstream to the muscle cells so them the tools| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20746 1:49 |and cousin the body functions| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20747 1:52 |best with the blood glucose in optimum level it does n't like it| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20748 1:57 |if it took a case rises too high normally| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20749 2:00 |there 's a cycle within the body which balances out| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20750 2:03 |the glucose and the international and this is achieved by| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20751 2:07 |the food you eat the pancreas and the liver| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20752 2:12 |however in some people the system does n't work properly| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20753 2:15 |and the developed diabetes for two main types of diabetes| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20754 2:19 |type 1 and talk to in type 1 diabetes| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20755 2:25 |the body is n't making any incident it 'll this is because| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20756 2:29 |all and autoimmune response whereby| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20757 2:32 |the body has destroyed the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20758 2:36 |we do n't entirely no why that happens in some people| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20759 2:40 |and not in others type 1 diabetes accounts for about 15 percent of all| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20760 2:46 cases Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20761 2:46 |is most often found in the in the forties| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20762 2:50 |and it 's by far the most common type of diabetes found in childhood| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20763 2:54 |end type 1 diabetes| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20764 2:58 |the carbohydrate containing food is broken down| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20765 3:01 |into glucose as normal that biko 's| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20766 3:05 |then moves into the bloodstream normally| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20767 3:09 |the body would produce insulin to let that peco 's| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20768 3:12 |into the cells but in type 1 diabetes| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20769 3:15 |there is no insulin being produced so the glucose| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20770 3:19 |called it into the body cells a tool| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20771 3:22 |so the level of glucose in the blood rice 's and rises| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20772 3:25 |the body tries to lower the level of glucose tries to get ridge 's the glucose| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20773 3:30 |through the kidneys that 's why people| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20774 3:34 |who have undiagnosed type 1 diabetes tend to go to the toilet a lot to pass| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20775 3:38 urine Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20776 3:40 |as the kidneys filter the glucose after the blowout| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20777 3:43 |they also take a lot of water with it so| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20778 3:47 |the person with diabetes will get very thirsty| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20779 3:50 |the urine contains a lot of glucose| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20780 3:54 |and that creates an environment where it 's quite easy for bacteria to thrive| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20781 3:58 |so it 's also quite common to get thrush for genital itching| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20782 4:01 |in the same way the blood contains a high level of glucose as well| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20783 4:07 |so more bacteria than usual will tend to breed in flesh wounds| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20784 4:11 |and they might be slow to heal biko 's can also build up in the lens| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20785 4:16 |at the front of the eye causing the liquid in the lens to become cloudy| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20786 4:20 |that could mean that some people with undiagnosed type 1 diabetes| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20787 4:24 |can have blurred vision to because the glucose competent to the cells| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20788 4:29 |to be used for energy somebody who 's got undiagnosed type 1 diabetes| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20789 4:34 |is going to start feeling very tired lethargic and unable to go about their| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20790 4:38 |normal daily routine| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20791 4:40 |that the body still needs an energy source in order to work properly| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20792 4:44 |so what it does is it starts to break down its facts tools| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20793 4:47 |and that can lead to weight loss and| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20794 4:50 |side the main symptoms have type 1 diabetes| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20795 4:54 |all going to the toilet a lot thirst truck show genital itching| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20796 4:59 |slow healing and wins blurred vision| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20797 5:02 |tiredness and weight loss good| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20798 5:06 |the symptoms generally happen quite quickly often over a few weeks| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20799 5:10 |and come be reversed once the diabetes is treated with insulin| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20800 5:14 |type 2 diabetes accounts for about 85 percent to full cases in the population| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20801 5:23 |his most common in the over 40 age group in the white population| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20802 5:27 |and in the over 25 age group in the blackpool south asian population| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20803 5:31 |type 2 diabetes is a little more complex because is slightly more processes at| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20804 5:37 work Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20805 5:38 |either the bodies and producing quite enough insulin| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20806 5:41 |all the incident is producing is n't working properly| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20807 5:45 |that 's can be due to being overweight| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20808 5:48 |because a build up a fact cam stop insulin doing its job properly| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20809 5:53 |but it can also happen in people other healthy weight| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20810 5:56 |so in type 2 diabetes the| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20811 6:00 |carbohydrate containing food is broken down into glucose| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20812 6:04 |in the stomach and digestive systems normal that biko 's| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20813 6:08 |then moves into the bloodstream the pancreas| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20814 6:12 |starts to produce insulin which moves with the peco 's| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20815 6:15 |through the bloodstream to all the body cells which need| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20816 6:18 |glucose for energy however the| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20817 6:21 |peco 's called always get into the cells because the locks to the cell dole 's| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20818 6:26 |have become third up with fat deposits that means that the| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20819 6:31 |insulin ca n't open the cell dole 's probably| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20820 6:34 |so the level of glucose in the blood continues to rise| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20821 6:38 |in response to this the pancreas produces| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20822 6:41 |even more insulin so the blood glucose levels continue to rise| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20823 6:45 |and the insulin levels continue to rise this situation| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20824 6:49 |is further complicated by the cells who are desperate for energy| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20825 6:53 |sending out emergency signals to the liver to release| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20826 6:57 |stored group has the blood glucose level goes| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20827 7:00 |up up and the country 's produces more and more insulin| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20828 7:03 |and telecom cope anymore and eventually eight minutes left| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20829 7:08 |as with type 1 diabetes the symptoms of type 2 diabetes| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20830 7:13 |all going to the toilet knots thirst| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20831 7:16 |30 should definitely ching slow healing of wounds| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20832 7:20 |blurred vision tiredness and weight loss in some people| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20833 7:24 |the symptoms for type 2 diabetes come along| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20834 7:28 |very slowly and some people do n't have any symptoms a tool| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20835 7:32 |so for that reason people can live with type 2 diabetes for up to 10 years| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20836 7:37 |before i realized that i have type 2 diabetes can be treated in a number of| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20837 7:42 |different ways| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20838 7:43 |initially it may be sufficient to make changes to the food you 're eating| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20839 7:47 |and to take extra physical activity or lose any weight| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20840 7:50 |that may be appropriate but type 2 diabetes| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20841 7:53 |is a progressive condition and most people need some form| Oq5J9CAI2hY
_*20842 7:57 |of medication to treat it| Oq5J9CAI2hY

_*20883 0:04 |title iv of the americans with disabilities act ( ada ) covers three areas .| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20884 0:10 |first , title iv prohibits telephone companies from discriminating against deaf and hard of hearing people .| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20885 0:15 |second , it mandated the creation of a national relay service program .| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20886 0:20 |this was a critical change in history because prior to this nationwide relay program , deaf and hard of hearing| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20887 0:24 |people had to ask hearing family , friends , and even neighbors to make calls for them .| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20888 0:28 |sometimes if they could n't find anyone to call , they 'd have to drive to places to convey a message .| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20889 0:32 |for example , perhaps a deaf parent would have to drive to her or his child 's school to let them know| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20890 0:34 |the child is sick at home .| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20891 0:36 |modern relay services provide deaf and hard of hearing people the same independence that others enjoy .| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20892 0:42 |with such relay services , deaf and hard of hearing people can be more productive in all areas including| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20893 0:45 |making appointments or having personal calls without having to rely on someone else to help .| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20894 0:48 |title iv also requires that the relay program is free without charge for everyone to use .| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20895 0:54 |title iv also mandates that the relay program be 24-hour , 7-days a week , all year long .| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20896 0:59 |relay calls must be functionally equivalent to calls made by hearing people .| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20897 1:08 |the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , who is responsible for overseeing the national relay program| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20898 1:13 |promotes not only existing technologies but also seeks to incorporate future technologies to| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20899 1:18 |enhance accessibility for all .| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20900 1:21 |we have seen the relay program grow in the last 25 years .| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20901 1:26 |the relay program at first only used ttys but today , we can use video relay services ( vrs ) , ip-relay ,| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20902 1:33 |and captioned telephones !| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20903 1:37 |with vrs , deaf and hard of hearing people can make calls with other hearing people by using our| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20904 1:41 |natural language , american sign language ( asl ) .| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20905 1:46 |finally , the third area of title iv requires captioning of all public announcements on television produced by| Fkqc2gKSn3s
_*20906 1:52 |the federal government or made possible through federal funds .| Fkqc2gKSn3s

_*20937 1:08 |girl . thumb down the cheek . ( like bonnet strings )| VxjRgmtKn5c
_*20938 1:12 |now , it 's good to remember that boy/male signs| VxjRgmtKn5c
_*20939 1:17 |are at the top half of the face .| VxjRgmtKn5c
_*20940 1:20 |and girl/female signs are at the bottom half of the face .| VxjRgmtKn5c

_*21173 0:03 |hi everyone , my name is bhavya .| GtoRl0US_vU
_*21174 0:08 |i must share more that relates with the story `` meeting amma at 3pm '' .| GtoRl0US_vU
_*21175 0:19 |ok immediately after i finished making the video , reviewing , and editing it ,| GtoRl0US_vU
_*21176 0:30 |..last night , i opened a website . i have it set automatically to go to amma 's official india website . why ?| GtoRl0US_vU
_*21177 0:49 |because they have amma quotes that change everytime you reload the page .| GtoRl0US_vU
_*21178 1:03 |many times , i like to see a quote , many times always have the perfect quote with what 's going on with me .| GtoRl0US_vU
_*21179 1:14 |ok , i did not plan to look at that website . i was going to open a different website .| GtoRl0US_vU
_*21180 1:20 |i opened and noticed a quote that was perfect explanation of the point of the story .| GtoRl0US_vU
_*21181 1:33 |i had to share it with you , add to it .| GtoRl0US_vU
_*21182 1:37 |amma said `` once you learn the art of relaxation , everything happens spontaneously and effortlessly . ''| GtoRl0US_vU
_*21183 1:52 |the point of my story of meeting amma at 3pm , did you notice how throughout the day , how relaxed i was .| GtoRl0US_vU
_*21184 2:05 |i allow , relax , no obsessing , no worrying , no forcing it . just enjoying the moment and allow amma guide me .| GtoRl0US_vU
_*21185 2:22 |that 's relaxation then the result was how i entered [ the meditation room ] perfectly at 3pm . wow .| GtoRl0US_vU
_*21186 2:39 |that 's the point of what amma says .| GtoRl0US_vU
_*21187 2:46 |and what 's also cool is that the picture of amma below the quote shows amma pointing towards the quote .| GtoRl0US_vU
_*21188 2:55 |amma herself was pointing ! the finger pointing also has another meaning , the point of the story . wow .| GtoRl0US_vU
_*21189 3:06 |i took a printscreen of it and will show it now . namaste .| GtoRl0US_vU

_*22382 0:09 |get the credit you deserve the small business health care tax credit| aKNX2yigVvo
_*22383 0:16 |whether you are a for-profit business| aKNX2yigVvo
_*22384 0:18 |or a tax-exempt group if you pay at least half the cost of premiums for| aKNX2yigVvo
_*22385 0:22 |single coverage health insurance for your employees| aKNX2yigVvo
_*22386 0:25 |you may be eligible them| aKNX2yigVvo
_*22387 0:33 |the credit has been around since tax year 2010 but some of the rules change| aKNX2yigVvo
_*22388 0:37 |for tax years beginning in 2014 or later| aKNX2yigVvo
_*22389 0:40 first aKNX2yigVvo
_*22390 0:44 |the maximum credit increases from 35 percent to 50 percent| aKNX2yigVvo
_*22391 0:48 |for small business employers and from 25 percent| aKNX2yigVvo
_*22392 0:52 |the thirty-five percent for small tax exempt employers| aKNX2yigVvo
_*22393 0:57 |next to claim the credit| aKNX2yigVvo
_*22394 1:00 |generally employers must offer employees insurance| aKNX2yigVvo
_*22395 1:03 |purchased through the small business health options program| aKNX2yigVvo
_*22396 1:06 |known as the shop marketplace and finally| aKNX2yigVvo

_*22398 1:17 |employers for two consecutive taxable years| aKNX2yigVvo
_*22399 1:20 |although the maximum credit amount changes| aKNX2yigVvo
_*22400 1:24 |the definition of a small employer has not usually| aKNX2yigVvo
_*22401 1:32 |a small employer for the purpose of the credit is an employer with fewer than 25| aKNX2yigVvo
_*22402 1:36 employees aKNX2yigVvo
_*22403 1:37 |and those employees must earn low to moderate wages| aKNX2yigVvo

_*22415 2:36 |you may be eligible to claim a business expense deduction for the difference| aKNX2yigVvo
_*22416 2:48 |that 's both the credit and the deduction for employee health insurance premium| aKNX2yigVvo
_*22417 2:52 payments aKNX2yigVvo

_*22638 0:01 |hello . my name is rosa lee and this video is about tips for parents| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22639 0:06 |when advocating for their children with special education needs .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22640 0:13 |special education law explicitly requires school districts to meet the unique learning needs| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22641 0:21 |of students with disabilities who receive special education services ,| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22642 0:26 |to prepare them to succeed as adults in employment and independent living .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22643 0:32 |parents and advocates often face challenges when trying to ensure that school districts| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22644 0:52 |parents often come to the disability law center ( dlc ) too late and with too little documentation .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22645 1:22 |unavoidably , disputes about services or placements sometimes do not resolve at the team meeting stage .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22646 1:27 |when that happens , it is important to remember the very key difference between what you know personally ,| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22647 1:37 |and what you are required to prove in a formal hearing at the bureau of special education appeals ( bsea ) .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22648 1:50 |the following tips will strengthen your case at team meetings and , if necessary , at administrative hearings .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22649 2:07 |tip # 1 : keep track of and organize important documents .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22650 2:17 |from the time your child starts school to when s/he leaves , you will accumulate hundreds of documents .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22651 2:21 |if eligible , your child is entitled to special education services from age 3 to when s/he either graduates or turns 22 .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22652 2:25 |that means you may have documents that span a course of more than 20 years !| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22653 2:31 |they will include the following ( and possibly many others ) :| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22654 2:34 |- individual education plans ( ieps )| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22655 2:36 |- evaluations and progress reports| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22656 2:41 |- standardized test results ( eg mcas ) and report cards| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22657 2:56 |- notes ( eg , from meetings and telephone calls )| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22658 3:02 |- forms and informal materials ( this might include information about new programs ,| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22659 3:06 |changes in programs or services , school system policies , or budget issues )| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22660 3:16 |- health and medical records| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22661 3:21 |it is important to keep copies of everything .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22662 3:24 |you might be tempted to throw things out ,| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22663 3:35 |for more appropriate special education services .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22664 3:48 |tip # 2 : put all requests , concerns , and objections in writing .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22665 3:58 |a basic reality for successful special education advocacy is that if you do not write it down , it did not happen !| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22666 4:19 |carefully review all notes and minutes from meetings ,| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22667 4:24 |and correct any inaccuracies or the failure to include important points raised at the team meeting .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22668 4:31 |do this by sending a letter .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22669 4:40 |carefully check the attendance sheet to make certain it correctly lists everyone who was there .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22670 4:46 |keep notes , or a record , of all objections .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22671 4:51 |voice any concerns you have at the team meeting , and make sure someone records those concerns .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22672 4:59 |if not , write a letter after the meeting to follow up .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22673 5:03 |state your understanding of what was agreed upon at the meeting and why you disagree .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22674 5:07 |this will help you later if you want to challenge portions of the iep with which you disagree .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22675 5:11 |if you reject the education plan , in whole or in part , send a letter to the school and explain why .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22676 5:23 |either hand-deliver your letter to the appropriate school personnel and get delivery confirmation ( a time-stamped copy ) ,| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22677 5:28 |or send the letter via certified mail , return receipt requested .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22678 5:36 |merely making a phone call is not enough , because there is no reliable record of the conversation .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22679 5:50 |tip # 3 : know what you are signing !| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22680 6:05 |as with any contract , you want to review the terms carefully| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22681 6:08 |and understand what you are agreeing to before signing .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22682 6:11 |although you need to complete your part of the paperwork within a reasonable time ,| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22683 6:15 |never feel pressured to sign an iep without having carefully considered it .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22684 6:38 |without paying attention to changes ( or lack thereof ) in goals , objectives , and measures of demonstrated effective progress .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22685 7:05 |you must be prepared to produce evidence and expert testimony about every disputed iep .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22686 7:34 |knowledgeable , credentialed experts can make or break a case .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22687 7:39 |share private evaluations or assessments with the team .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22688 7:43 |consider bringing private evaluators to the team meeting| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22689 7:45 |or have them participate via speaker phone to present their report and recommendations .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22690 7:55 |if you go to a bsea hearing , it is critical that the expert evaluator :| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22691 8:03 |( 1 ) be available to testify| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22692 8:06 |( 2 ) have direct knowledge about your child and his/her disability| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22693 8:21 |submitting a report is not enough .| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22694 8:24 |experts who have personally both evaluated your child and observed a program| tLpY8kulZPk
_*22695 8:37 |and have not observed the program themselves .| tLpY8kulZPk

_*22728 0:22 |understand that when we use speech , we form symbols by the use of air coming| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22729 0:27 |through our vocal chords and the position of our tongue and the position of our lips .| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22730 0:35 |and it seems to be impossible to think of any other way of forming symbols .| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22731 0:38 |but the use of the hands , and expression , the location , the movement ,| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22732 0:46 |the handshapes ... um ... is infinitely variable in the same way that sounds are , produced| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22733 1:01 |the most significant part of the grammar which is very different to spoken languages| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22734 1:06 |is the use of expression , and the use of facial expression . it is part of the grammar .| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22735 1:41 |[ eileen ] if you took signing away from deaf people , what would they lose ?| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22736 1:47 |[ eileen ] how would it affect their knowledge ?| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22737 1:51 |the best illustration i think is an historical one . and going back to this hundred years of| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22738 1:59 |education where sign language was banned , i think is a really good illustration . because| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22739 2:04 |often the children would spend a whole day learning how to pronounce the word| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22740 2:21 |so by the use of sign language , and..either directly from a teacher who is signing , or| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22741 2:32 |a hearing teacher who is speaking with the use of interpreters , the lesson becomes one| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22742 2:40 |of knowledge and concepts rather than how to pronounce something .| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22743 2:56 |understanding of the world . they might be able to say things , and read , but without| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22744 3:08 |the depth of understanding that the younger people do .| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22745 3:36 |choose to use the newer technologies such as cochlear implants .| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22746 4:26 |sign language is..um.. are both english speaking countries , they are completely| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22747 4:36 |different , it even has a different alphabet .| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22748 4:47 |i think , um , when i meet a spanish deaf person the mannerisms tend to be more| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22749 4:57 |familiar to me from within the deaf community than meeting a spanish| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22750 4:57 |familiar to me from within the deaf community than meeting a spanish| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22751 5:06 |speaking person . um..because of the mannerisms , the way that as i mentioned| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22752 5:14 |before , the expression is part of the grammar . deaf people tend to be very direct ,| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22753 5:20 |and very blunt ... so that is a cultural aspect that is quite different .| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22754 5:30 |different things are valued . i think , for example , historically deaf people have| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22755 6:25 |generalizing of course . [ eileen : of course , yes ] there are some deaf people who| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22756 6:30 |succeeded very , very well in the education system despite the barriers that were put in| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22757 6:35 |place . but as a general statement , the literacy levels were quite low .| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22758 6:43 |so , not only were deaf people not able to phone each other but to get information| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22759 6:49 |through the newspapers might be very difficult as well . no opportunity to hear things| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22760 6:55 |on the radio , television was impossible to read because there were no subtitles .| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22761 8:06 |up until that point i was just learning , going to one class per week . but at this total| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22762 8:12 |immersion weekend we had a number of deaf people who came along to help the| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22763 8:16 |students develop language . and at meal times there could be eighty people| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22764 8:27 |people talking would be very noisy . but eighty people who are using sign language ,| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22765 9:37 |see other deaf people on a regular basis , and to exchange that information . and also ,| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22766 10:06 |people who are in that core are the very strong deaf families , who have a genetic| ytzjp0A7R6g
_*22767 10:41 |of them but i can never be deaf .| ytzjp0A7R6g

_*22859 0:18 universities SVh511GQeo0
_*22860 0:19 |truth be told| SVh511GQeo0
_*22861 0:24 |i never graduated from college| SVh511GQeo0
_*22862 0:27 |and now this is the closest| SVh511GQeo0
_*22863 0:30 |i never got into college graduation today| SVh511GQeo0
_*22864 0:36 |i want to tell you three stories from my life that 's it| SVh511GQeo0
_*22865 0:39 |no big deal just three stories the first story| SVh511GQeo0
_*22866 0:44 |it 's not connecting the dots i dropped out every college| SVh511GQeo0
_*22867 0:49 |after the first six months but that state around is a drop in for another| SVh511GQeo0
_*22868 0:53 |18 months or so before i really quick so why not drop out| SVh511GQeo0
_*22869 0:57 |it started before i was born| SVh511GQeo0
_*22870 1:01 |my biological mother was a young| SVh511GQeo0
_*22871 1:05 |on wed graduate student and she decided to put me up for adoption she felt very| SVh511GQeo0
_*22872 1:10 |strongly that i should be adopted by college graduates| SVh511GQeo0
_*22873 1:13 |so everything 's all set for me to be adopted at birth by lawyer| SVh511GQeo0
_*22874 1:17 |in his wife except when i popped out| SVh511GQeo0
_*22875 1:20 |they decided at the last minute that they really want a girl| SVh511GQeo0
_*22876 1:23 |so my parents were on a waiting list| SVh511GQeo0
_*22877 1:27 |call in the middle of the night asking we got an unexpected| SVh511GQeo0
_*22878 1:31 |baby boy do you want they said| SVh511GQeo0
_*22879 1:35 |course my biological mother found out later| SVh511GQeo0
_*22880 1:40 |my mother had never graduated from college my father had never graduated| SVh511GQeo0
_*22881 1:44 |from high school| SVh511GQeo0
_*22882 1:45 |she refused to sign the final adoption papers| SVh511GQeo0
_*22883 1:49 |she only lets in a few months later| SVh511GQeo0
_*22884 1:52 |my purist promised that i would go to college| SVh511GQeo0
_*22885 1:55 |this was the start in my life| SVh511GQeo0
_*22886 1:59 |and seventeen years later| SVh511GQeo0
_*22887 2:02 |i did go to college but i naively chose a college| SVh511GQeo0
_*22888 2:06 |it was almost as expensive stanford in all of my working-class parents savings| SVh511GQeo0
_*22889 2:11 |will be spent on my college tuition| SVh511GQeo0
_*22890 2:13 |after six months i could n't see the value in it i had no idea what i wanted| SVh511GQeo0
_*22891 2:19 |to do with my life| SVh511GQeo0
_*22892 2:20 |and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out| SVh511GQeo0
_*22893 2:23 |and here i was spending all the money my parents say their entire life| SVh511GQeo0
_*22894 2:28 |so i decided to drop out| SVh511GQeo0
_*22895 2:31 |entrusted with all work out okay it was pretty scary the time| SVh511GQeo0
_*22896 2:36 |but looking back it was one of the best decisions i ever made| SVh511GQeo0
_*22897 2:39 |the minute i dropped out i could stop taking the required classes that did n't| SVh511GQeo0
_*22898 2:45 |interest me| SVh511GQeo0
_*22899 2:46 |and begin dropping in on the ones that looks far more interesting| SVh511GQeo0
_*22900 2:50 |it was n't all romantic i did n't have a dorm room| SVh511GQeo0
_*22901 2:55 |so i slept on the floor entrance rooms i returned coke bottles for the five-cent| SVh511GQeo0
_*22902 2:59 |deposits to buy food with| SVh511GQeo0
_*22903 3:01 |and i would walk the seven miles across town every sunday night| SVh511GQeo0
_*22904 3:05 |to get one good meal a week at the hari krishna temple| SVh511GQeo0
_*22905 3:08 |i loved it and much when i stumbled into| SVh511GQeo0
_*22906 3:12 |by following my curiosity intuition turned out to be priceless later on| SVh511GQeo0
_*22907 3:16 |let me give you one example re college at that time| SVh511GQeo0
_*22908 3:22 |offer perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country| SVh511GQeo0
_*22909 3:25 |throughout the campus every poster| SVh511GQeo0
_*22910 3:28 |every label on every drawer was beautifully hand telegraphed| SVh511GQeo0
_*22911 3:32 |because i it dropped out and did n't have to take the normal classes| SVh511GQeo0
_*22912 3:36 |i decided to take the clippers the class to learn how to do this| SVh511GQeo0
_*22913 3:39 |i learned about sarah since answer typefaces| SVh511GQeo0
_*22914 3:43 |about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations| SVh511GQeo0
_*22915 3:46 |about what makes great typography great it was beautiful| SVh511GQeo0
_*22916 3:51 |historical artistically subtle in a way that science ca n't capture| SVh511GQeo0
_*22917 3:56 |and i found it fast none of this| SVh511GQeo0
_*22918 4:00 |had even hoped many practical applications in my life| SVh511GQeo0
_*22919 4:03 |but 10 years later when we were designing the first macintosh computer| SVh511GQeo0
_*22920 4:08 |it all came back to me and we designed it| SVh511GQeo0
_*22921 4:11 |all into the mac it was the first computer with beautiful typography| SVh511GQeo0
_*22922 4:15 |if i it never dropped in on that single course in college .| SVh511GQeo0
_*22923 4:19 |the mac would have never had multiple typefaces are proportionally spaced| SVh511GQeo0
_*22924 4:23 thoughts SVh511GQeo0
_*22925 4:24 |and since windows just copied the mac it 's likely that no personal computer| SVh511GQeo0
_*22926 4:28 |what happened % ah| SVh511GQeo0
_*22927 4:37 |if i it never dropped out i would have never dropped in on that calligraphy| SVh511GQeo0
_*22928 4:40 class SVh511GQeo0
_*22929 4:41 |and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do| SVh511GQeo0
_*22930 4:45 |course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when i was in| SVh511GQeo0
_*22931 4:49 college SVh511GQeo0
_*22932 4:50 |but it was very very clear looking backwards ten years later| SVh511GQeo0
_*22933 4:54 |again you ca n't connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them| SVh511GQeo0
_*22934 4:58 |looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots| SVh511GQeo0
_*22935 5:01 |somehow connecting your future you have to trust is something| SVh511GQeo0
_*22936 5:05 |you 've got destiny life karma whatever| SVh511GQeo0
_*22937 5:09 |because believing that the dots neck down the road| SVh511GQeo0
_*22938 5:12 |will give you the confidence to follow your heart even want to teach you| SVh511GQeo0
_*22939 5:16 |of the well-worn path and that will make all the difference| SVh511GQeo0
_*22940 5:25 |my second story is about love in los| SVh511GQeo0
_*22941 5:29 |i was lucky i found what i love to do| SVh511GQeo0
_*22942 5:34 |early in life laws and i started apple my parents garage when i was 20| SVh511GQeo0
_*22943 5:38 |we work toward in 10 years ap lit room for just the two of us in the crotch| SVh511GQeo0
_*22944 5:43 |into a two billion dollar company with over 4,000 employees| SVh511GQeo0
_*22945 5:46 |we just released our finest creations the macintosh| SVh511GQeo0
_*22946 5:50 |a year earlier and i just turned 30 and then i got fired| SVh511GQeo0
_*22947 5:54 |how can you get fired from a company you started| SVh511GQeo0
_*22948 5:58 |well as apple crew| SVh511GQeo0
_*22949 6:01 |we hired someone who i thought was very talented to run the company with me| SVh511GQeo0
_*22950 6:05 |for the first year so things went well but there are visions the future begin| SVh511GQeo0
_*22951 6:09 |to diverge| SVh511GQeo0
_*22952 6:10 |and eventually we had a falling out when we did| SVh511GQeo0
_*22953 6:13 |our board of directors sided with him and so 30| SVh511GQeo0
_*22954 6:17 |i was out and very publicly out what has been the focus my entire adult life was| SVh511GQeo0
_*22955 6:22 gone SVh511GQeo0
_*22956 6:23 |and it was devastating i really did n't know what to do for a few months| SVh511GQeo0
_*22957 6:27 |i still thought i 'd let the previous generation entrepreneurs down| SVh511GQeo0
_*22958 6:31 |that i dropped the baton is it was being passed me i met with david packard and| SVh511GQeo0
_*22959 6:36 bottomless SVh511GQeo0
_*22960 6:37 |and try to apologize for screwing up so badly i was a very public failure and i| SVh511GQeo0
_*22961 6:43 |even thought about running away from the valley but something slowly began to| SVh511GQeo0
_*22962 6:47 |dawn on me| SVh511GQeo0
_*22963 6:47 |i still love idea the trial defense apple is not change that one bit| SVh511GQeo0
_*22964 6:54 |i 've been rejected but i was still unlocked| SVh511GQeo0
_*22965 6:57 |and so i decided to start over i did n't see it then| SVh511GQeo0
_*22966 7:03 |it turned out that getting fired from apple was the best thing that could have| SVh511GQeo0
_*22967 7:06 |ever happened to me| SVh511GQeo0
_*22968 7:07 |the heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness| SVh511GQeo0
_*22969 7:11 |being a beginner again less sure about everything treat me dinner with was| SVh511GQeo0
_*22970 7:16 |created periods in my life| SVh511GQeo0
_*22971 7:17 |during the next five years i started a company name next| SVh511GQeo0
_*22972 7:21 |another company pixar and fell in love with an amazing| SVh511GQeo0
_*22973 7:24 |would become my wife pixar went on to create the world 's first computer| SVh511GQeo0
_*22974 7:28 |animated feature film| SVh511GQeo0
_*22975 7:30 |toy story and is now the most successful animation studio| SVh511GQeo0
_*22976 7:33 |in the world in a remarkable turn of events| SVh511GQeo0
_*22977 7:38 |apple what next and i returned to apple| SVh511GQeo0
_*22978 7:41 |and the technology we developed next is at the heart applescript| SVh511GQeo0
_*22979 7:45 |renaissance and 39 have a wonderful family| SVh511GQeo0
_*22980 7:49 |i 'm pretty sure none of this would happen if i had been fired from apple| SVh511GQeo0
_*22981 7:54 |it was awful tasting medicine but i guess the patient needed| SVh511GQeo0
_*22982 7:58 |sometime life sometimes life 's gon na hit you in the head with a brick| SVh511GQeo0
_*22983 8:02 |do n't lose faith i 'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going| SVh511GQeo0
_*22984 8:07 |is that i loved what i did you 've got to find what you love| SVh511GQeo0
_*22985 8:11 |and that is true for work as it is for you lovers| SVh511GQeo0
_*22986 8:14 |your work is gon na still large part your life| SVh511GQeo0
_*22987 8:17 |and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work| SVh511GQeo0
_*22988 8:21 |and the only way to do great work is to love| SVh511GQeo0
_*22989 8:24 |what you do if you have n't found it yet cheap-looking| SVh511GQeo0
_*22990 8:28 |and do n't settle as with all matters of the heart| SVh511GQeo0
_*22991 8:32 |you 'll know when you find it and like any great relationship it just gets| SVh511GQeo0
_*22992 8:36 |better and better| SVh511GQeo0
_*22993 8:37 |as the years roll on so keep looking do n't settle| SVh511GQeo0
_*22994 8:41 well SVh511GQeo0
_*22995 8:52 |my third story is about death| SVh511GQeo0
_*22996 8:55 |when i was 17 i read a quote that meant something| SVh511GQeo0
_*22997 8:59 |like if you live each day as if it was your last| SVh511GQeo0
_*22998 9:02 |someday you 'll most certainly the right it made an impression on me| SVh511GQeo0
_*22999 9:09 |and since then for the past 33 years i 've looked in the mirror every morning| SVh511GQeo0
_*23000 9:13 |and asked myself| SVh511GQeo0
_*23001 9:15 |is today where the last day of my life what i want to do| SVh511GQeo0
_*23002 9:18 |what i 'm about to do today and whenever the answer is that no| SVh511GQeo0
_*23003 9:22 |for too many days in a row i know we need to change some remembering that all| SVh511GQeo0
_*23004 9:28 be SVh511GQeo0
_*23005 9:28 |did n't seem is the most important tool i 've ever encountered to help me make| SVh511GQeo0
_*23006 9:32 |the big choices in life| SVh511GQeo0
_*23007 9:34 |because almost everything all external expectations| SVh511GQeo0
_*23008 9:38 |all pride all fear of embarrassment or failure these things just fall away| SVh511GQeo0
_*23009 9:43 |in the face of death leaving only what is truly important| SVh511GQeo0
_*23010 9:47 |remembering that you were going to die is the best way i know| SVh511GQeo0
_*23011 9:51 |to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose| SVh511GQeo0
_*23012 9:54 |you are already naked there is no reason| SVh511GQeo0
_*23013 9:57 |not to follow your heart about a year ago| SVh511GQeo0
_*23014 10:01 |i was diagnosed with cancer i had a scan at 7:30 in the morning| SVh511GQeo0
_*23015 10:07 |and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas i did n't even know what up| SVh511GQeo0
_*23016 10:11 |increase was| SVh511GQeo0
_*23017 10:12 |the doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer| SVh511GQeo0
_*23018 10:16 |that is insurable and that i should expect to live no longer| SVh511GQeo0
_*23019 10:20 |than three to six months my doctor advised me to go home| SVh511GQeo0
_*23020 10:24 |and get my affairs order which is doctors code| SVh511GQeo0
_*23021 10:28 |for prepare to die it means to try and tell your kids everything| SVh511GQeo0
_*23022 10:33 |you thought you 'd have the next 10 years to tell| SVh511GQeo0
_*23023 10:36 |in just a few months it means to make sure| SVh511GQeo0
_*23024 10:39 |everything is buttoned up so that will be issues is possible for your fam| SVh511GQeo0
_*23025 10:43 |the means to say you 're the boss i live with that diagnosis all day| SVh511GQeo0
_*23026 10:50 |later that evening i had a biopsy with a second endoscope down my throat| SVh511GQeo0
_*23027 10:55 |through my son into my intestines put a needle into my pancreas and got a few| SVh511GQeo0
_*23028 11:00 |cells from the tumor| SVh511GQeo0
_*23029 11:01 |i was sedated my life was there| SVh511GQeo0
_*23030 11:05 |told me that when a few the cells under a microscope| SVh511GQeo0
_*23031 11:08 |the doctor started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of| SVh511GQeo0
_*23032 11:12 |pancreatic cancer| SVh511GQeo0
_*23033 11:13 |it is curable by surgery i had the surgery| SVh511GQeo0
_*23034 11:16 |and thankfully i 'm fine| SVh511GQeo0
_*23035 11:27 |this was the closest i 've been to facing death| SVh511GQeo0
_*23036 11:30 |i hope it 's the closest i get for a few more decades| SVh511GQeo0
_*23037 11:33 |having lived through it i can now say this to you| SVh511GQeo0
_*23038 11:36 |with a bit more certainty than one death was a useful but surely| SVh511GQeo0
_*23039 11:39 |intellectual concept no one| SVh511GQeo0
_*23040 11:43 |wants to die even people who want to go to heaven| SVh511GQeo0
_*23041 11:46 |do n't wan na die to get there and yet deficit destination we all share| SVh511GQeo0
_*23042 11:52 |no one is ever skated and that is| SVh511GQeo0
_*23043 11:55 |as it should be because death is very likely the single best invention of life| SVh511GQeo0
_*23044 12:01 |it sliced change agent it tears up the old to make way for the new| SVh511GQeo0
_*23045 12:05 |right now the new issue but someday not too long from now| SVh511GQeo0
_*23046 12:11 |you will gradually become the old and be cleared away| SVh511GQeo0
_*23047 12:14 |sorry to be so dramatic but it 's quite true| SVh511GQeo0
_*23048 12:18 |your time is limited so do n't waste it living someone else 's life| SVh511GQeo0
_*23049 12:24 |do n't be trapped by talking which is living with the results| SVh511GQeo0
_*23050 12:28 |other people 's thinking do n't let the noise of others opinions drown out your| SVh511GQeo0
_*23051 12:32 |own inner voice| SVh511GQeo0
_*23052 12:33 |and most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition| SVh511GQeo0
_*23053 12:37 |they somehow already know what you truly want to become| SVh511GQeo0
_*23054 12:41 |everything else is second % ah| SVh511GQeo0
_*23055 12:56 |when i was young there was an amazing publication| SVh511GQeo0
_*23056 12:59 |call the whole earth catalog which is one of the bible 's| SVh511GQeo0
_*23057 13:03 |my generation it was created by a fellow named stewart brand| SVh511GQeo0

_*23059 13:11 touch SVh511GQeo0
_*23060 13:12 |this was in the late sixties for personal computers in desktop publishing| SVh511GQeo0
_*23061 13:16 |so it was all made with typewriters scissors and polaroid cameras| SVh511GQeo0
_*23062 13:20 |it was sort of like google in paperback form thirty-five years before google| SVh511GQeo0
_*23063 13:25 |came along it was idealistic| SVh511GQeo0
_*23064 13:27 |overflowing with the tools and great notions| SVh511GQeo0
_*23065 13:31 |stork and his team put out several issues at the whole earth catalog| SVh511GQeo0

_*23241 0:16 |i 'm gon na give you a slightly the unique kinda presentation| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23242 0:20 |because i 'm gon na invite you to engage with me| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23243 0:24 |an indirect a little bit in a couple minutes i 'm going to| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23244 0:28 |invite you to take some notes about a specific topic then i 'll be suggesting| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23245 0:33 |just for yourself| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23246 0:34 |and you 'll get maximum value out what i 'm going to share with you| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23247 0:38 |if you play in order to play you need something to take notes with| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23248 0:43 |so if you already have some sort of note-taking device that 'll work fine| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23249 0:47 |if you do n't underneath your seats the 10x folks have put a pin| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23250 0:51 |and a blank card which should work fine if you use both sides about| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23251 0:56 |i love| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23252 1:00 |having clear space inside myself with absolutely nothing on my mind| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23253 1:05 |which gives me the freedom to be as much me as i can be| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23254 1:08 |wherever i show up and whatever i 'm doing and also to be able to trust that| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23255 1:13 |what i 'm doing| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23256 1:14 |is the best thing to be doing given my intuition and spontaneous judgments| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23257 1:19 |that 's cool state to be in so i developed some processes| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23258 1:24 |that really allow that to happen now| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23259 1:27 |that 's because i needed them tremendously myself first| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23260 1:30 |and then i had the great opportunity to share a lot of those ideas with a lot of| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23261 1:34 |people around the world| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23262 1:35 |now i spent a lotta years not feeling clear| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23263 1:40 |and not feeling free and having my stuff bout me around much like a pinball in an| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23264 1:45 old xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23265 1:45 |arcade game and| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23266 1:49 |what are things well we we teach what we need to learn the most| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23267 1:52 |and i discovered know that most people| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23268 1:56 |also have something that is hanging them up something that they should be| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23269 2:00 |thinking about something that pulling on their attention something is draining| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23270 2:03 |the energy| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23271 2:03 |usually at some project some problem some situation coming at them| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23272 2:08 |and they 're just resisting hopping into it and thinking about it| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23273 2:11 |appropriately to be able to be appropriately managing| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23274 2:15 |until of course the last minute how many can relate to what i 'm talking about hi| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23275 2:23 |well i discovered the best technique for handling those kinds of things| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23276 2:27 |and i 'm work with the ceo a major corporation that used to quickly| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23277 2:31 |manage a strategic issue i| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23278 2:35 |used it with two people that used it together to got agreement about| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23279 2:39 |who to invite to the wedding and lots of things in between all that| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23280 2:43 |here 's the cool thing you already know how to do this| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23281 2:47 |so i 'm gon na take invite you to take a little short test drive with me| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23282 2:50 |on something very real in your world right now something that you have| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23283 2:54 |attention on| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23284 2:55 |i and if you think about| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23285 2:59 |on your radar what 's coming toward you a project| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23286 3:02 |and advent something you need to deal with a speech you need to give somebody| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23287 3:06 |need to hire| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23288 3:07 |a party you need to give something to celebrate something you need to organize| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23289 3:11 |or think about| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23290 3:12 |do you have something you that some part abuse thinking you ought to be| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23291 3:16 |thinking about a little bit more and close your eyes just for a second| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23292 3:21 |and let emerge whatever most has your attention| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23293 3:24 |that nature and then| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23294 3:27 |in your notes would you just write that down pick a topic| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23295 3:31 |an event or a project the real thing right now that perhaps his most| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23296 3:35 |on your mind has most has your attention now| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23297 3:43 |years ago i was quite curious about what 's the best way to plan| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23298 3:47 |i did n't seem to see any particular planning model that work for everything| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23299 3:52 universally xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23300 3:53 |and was foolproof so i went in search love| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23301 3:56 |who knows how to do this i went in search of the master planner| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23302 4:00 |and i found in her| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23303 4:03 |you all know it very well its your brain| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23304 4:08 |now there 's some things your brain does not do very well| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23305 4:13 |it forgets were laid up| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23306 4:17 |later keys down and does n't handle| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23307 4:20 |trying to track more the four things at once but there 's something your brain| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23308 4:24 |does brilliantly| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23309 4:25 |automatically ca n't help it and one of them is planned you 're planning machine| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23310 4:31 |you 're planning all the time you ca n't help plan| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23311 4:35 |you planned what to wear here today you plan how to get here| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23312 4:39 |you plant where to sit you planned lunch you planned want to talk to people not| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23313 4:42 |on the break| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23314 4:43 |you ca n't help it you are a natural planner| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23315 4:46 |it 's going on all time probably because i 've| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23316 4:49 |evolutionary you know over millennia the brain| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23317 4:53 |figured out that that was something that got going to survive survival species| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23318 4:57 |g how do i get away from the bear coming at me| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23319 5:00 |how do i get fruit on the tree or how do i create a relationship with that| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23320 5:04 |attractive person survival species| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23321 5:07 |so you doing all the time| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23322 5:11 |and it 's good you know grown over linear actually do this naturally| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23323 5:15 |and even for you personally you been planning since you were six| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23324 5:19 |month old because it 's six months is when the| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23325 5:23 |executive function wakes up in your forebrain and that 's when you decide to| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23326 5:27 |throw a tantrum| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23327 5:28 |to get something you know happier and you 've been planning since then you 're| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23328 5:33 |really good at this| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23329 5:34 |so i ask myself that wait a minute what is this natural planning model that| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23330 5:38 |we 're all using all the time| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23331 5:39 |and i came up with some interesting stuff and i discovered that this natural| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23332 5:44 |planning model is actually a recognizable five-phase more model| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23333 5:48 |organically that we use to take anything from in polls| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23334 5:51 |into reality was like a couple simple examples to| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23335 5:56 |walk you through that and also what you picked as a topic| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23336 5:59 |will also let you apply it to that 's what happens| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23337 6:03 |art let 's suppose that the this a thirty thousand years ago and you encounter| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23338 6:07 |this guy| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23339 6:08 |or its tonight then you 're thinking about dinner| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23340 6:11 |going up now what would cause you to think about| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23341 6:15 |anything about those situations right well obviously bear shows up| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23342 6:20 |first thing on my mind is survive| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23343 6:23 |live no pain all body parts intact dinner tonight why would you think about| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23344 6:29 |dinner tonight well the| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23345 6:30 |the nothing in the kitchen and i 'm hungry or i want to sign a business deal| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23346 6:34 |with the| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23347 6:34 |prospective client or romance| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23348 6:38 |somebody but what starts natural planning to begin with as a real purpose| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23349 6:43 |some real intention| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23350 6:44 |something that you need to have occur or happen| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23351 6:48 |what i could do right now let 's take a moment| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23352 6:51 |and think about whatever it is you picked as a topic or project an answer| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23353 6:56 |this question| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23354 6:57 |just very briefly for yourself in a phrase or sentence what is the main| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23355 7:00 reason xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23356 7:01 |this thing exist or what is the primary purpose| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23357 7:05 |for this event just jot down think for a moment what that is and jot that down| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23358 7:10 now xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23359 7:18 |by the way if you decide you 're not writing just wan na think about it that 's| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23360 7:20 |fine but| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23361 7:21 |you 'll come up with better and more ideas if you actually write stuff down| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23362 7:24 |what happens next| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23363 7:28 |1x what happens is not some detail plan about your thing| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23364 7:31 |next what happens as you play writer producer director and in your mind you| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23365 7:35 |go out to the in| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23366 7:36 |and you produce a vision of success what is| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23367 7:40 |my final ideal scenario and outcome going to be on this| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23368 7:43 |terms the bear hope i want to be back in my own warm came with my mate| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23369 7:48 |say from warm terms of dinner| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23370 7:51 |pay be a fun evening good food and wine may be a sign business deal| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23371 7:55 |maybe romance in multiple forms you create a vision first| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23372 8:01 |so would you take the next few moments and ask yourself| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23373 8:04 |okay what what success means to me for what i picked here| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23374 8:08 |how would you describe and you can you know develop this out later| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23375 8:12 |so grab some key words are just thoughts just quickly now| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23376 8:15 |jot down what would mean success for you with this| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23377 8:18 |event with this thing you picked go this will happen faster told| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23378 8:26 now xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23379 8:27 |what do you do next well what happens next assuming you want this vision to| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23380 8:30 |actually occur| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23381 8:31 |is you 're gon na have to deal with them image a reality that does not match by| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23382 8:36 |your current reality| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23383 8:37 |that creates tension in your brain so even imagined a reality that 's not true| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23384 8:41 yet xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23385 8:42 |some party goes there 's a delta there 's a gap between where i am| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23386 8:46 |and what i want . so what your brain does then is try to relieve that pressure on| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23387 8:51 |it does it by generating| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23388 8:52 |all kinds of ideas potentially useful ideas potentially relevant ideas| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23389 8:57 |about how to get from here to there it does it in somewhat random order by the| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23390 9:01 way xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23391 9:01 |no particular logical sequence or wat they just start to show up| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23392 9:05 |what might be relevant about the situation terms the bear| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23393 9:08 |who public the bear public in my life know how shoppers my spear| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23394 9:12 |is there a tree i can run up is it is an angry was n't hungry| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23395 9:16 |and dinner well as| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23396 9:19 |where we gon na goal and what 's the weather like and what time would be| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23397 9:22 going xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23398 9:23 |people i 'm going with them i just okay so what starts here by the way| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23399 9:28 |is a storm that happens in your brain by holding this picture| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23400 9:31 |it 's called brainstorm exactly so what i 'd like to do now is take the next few| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23401 9:36 |moments and| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23402 9:37 |come up with and many things as you can possibly come up with in just a few| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23403 9:41 |moments here| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23404 9:42 |little things big things does n't matter jot down anything that pops your head to| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23405 9:46 |draw a line| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23406 9:46 |just make a huge list to remind them for whatever you 'd like to do| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23407 9:49 |real quick anything that might be potentially relevant| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23408 9:53 |about your project or topic against assuming you want to have this thing| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23409 9:58 |actually occur| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23410 9:59 |some party is gon na take those somewhat random ideas| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23411 10:02 |and start to create a structure you gon na start organize and this is where| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23412 10:06 |you gon na bring their critical logical rational thinking to bear| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23413 10:10 |now you 're gon na evaluate big purses little best| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23414 10:13 |what 's the best idea was the first thing i need to do what 's most important thing| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23415 10:17 |so usually you will start to structure your day your data based upon sequences| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23416 10:21 |have things| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23417 10:22 |or critical components or priorities| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23418 10:25 |you know if it 's the bear hello okay for smaller| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23419 10:29 |i need to see how the beer feels a need to see how far that reas| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23420 10:32 |out there and then i 'm going to slowly move that way in terms of dinner well| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23421 10:36 |let 's see a need to find out if people wan na go| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23422 10:38 |need to call my favorite restaurant menu to see if they can take| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23423 10:40 |s et cetera and so that 's the kind of structuring we do now we can start to| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23424 10:45 |lay that out| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23425 10:45 |what i 'd like to do is take the next few moments and just pick the three most| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23426 10:50 |important things| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23427 10:51 |you think you need to handle or deal with in terms whatever you 've picked| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23428 10:55 here xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23429 10:55 |two or three and if you 've already written down circle bomber number them| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23430 10:59 |just a simple little plan now| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23431 11:08 |what are you naturally do and this may be the most important piece| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23432 11:11 |the natural planning model now what you do assuming you want to have something| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23433 11:15 happen xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23434 11:16 |is going to take all that thinking and drill it right down into what 's the| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23435 11:19 |very next thing that needs to happen to move this thing forward| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23436 11:23 |what is the very next action that needs to happen on this| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23437 11:27 |so in terms the bear i 'm gon na go okay i 'm gon na sit still for 10 seconds| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23438 11:31 |and i the tree over there terms the roster| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23439 11:35 |i 'm gon na call the bistro and see if they can take to us at 1900 for your| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23440 11:40 thing xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23441 11:40 |if you were gon na walk out right after this| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23442 11:44 |and the only thing you 're going to do is make progress on what you 're thinking| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23443 11:47 |about working on right now| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23444 11:48 |what 's the very next physical bizzle action you would take| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23445 11:51 |is it in the mail the same phone call to make a conversation to have with the| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23446 11:55 boss xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23447 11:56 |something to surf the web about from the goodbye to hardware store| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23448 11:59 |what is it and it needs to be very specific visual| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23449 12:03 |thing i could see you doing so set meeting is not| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23450 12:06 |specific enough how would you set the meeting what activity| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23451 12:09 |so take a couple moments the side with the very next| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23452 12:13 |action is you would need to take to make forward progress on your thing| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23453 12:16 |and write that down| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23454 12:23 |soul how many do you actually came up with a reasonably trustworthy next| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23455 12:27 |action i 'm curious| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23456 12:28 |but okay cool how many police found this a constructive two minutes of thinking| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23457 12:33 |you feel a little more on top of your game a little clearer about what your| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23458 12:35 |surface and you| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23459 12:36 |okay well welcome to the natural planning model| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23460 12:41 |now i 'm sure the burning question for many beers| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23461 12:44 |david so what here 's the so what| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23462 12:49 |that 's the natural model is this the normal model is this how your wedding| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23463 12:53 |reception was planned is this how your of flight was managed| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23464 12:55 |is this how you launch your product this are you pr campaign was set up| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23465 13:00 |what i 've discovered is the natural model is not necessarily the normal one| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23466 13:03 |what 's more normal i 've seen is something that i refer to as the| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23467 13:07 |unnatural planning model| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23468 13:08 |what 's that you ever had a boss or manager or director| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23469 13:12 |bring together the team color gon na try to be collaborative they bring you all| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23470 13:15 |in a room because we 're now going to stick together about a problem or a| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23471 13:18 project xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23472 13:19 |and they approach this my saying okay who 's got a good idea here| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23473 13:24 now xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23474 13:27 |where does that automatically you assume that you are in the natural planning| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23475 13:31 model xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23476 13:31 |because the know a good idea that your critical rational logical thinking about| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23477 13:35 |what 's good better best| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23478 13:36 |where 's that stage 4 stage 4| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23479 13:42 |in order to make sure you may have the right idea or a good idea you need to| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23480 13:47 |make sure purpose has been to find that the| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23481 13:49 |the vision is clear that you generate all the potential bit italy relevant| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23482 13:53 |data that might need to be taken into consideration before you can hope to| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23483 13:56 |know what 's a good her best idea| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23484 13:58 |guess what folks we now have the genetically modified planning model| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23485 14:02 |unnatural and if you try to start| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23486 14:06 |that way that so unnatural people naturally| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23487 14:09 |resist and they do n't play often times as passive resistance they just the| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23488 14:13 |on a team or even for their own selves they do that yeah| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23489 14:20 |then what happens is people do n't really plan and if you do n't really plan what| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23490 14:23 happens xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23491 14:23 |ok trouble it follows on my head| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23492 14:27 |did you get that i did n't get that i thought that and the conflict and the| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23493 14:30 |but lack of clarity last-minute crises pressure stress| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23494 14:34 |no fun by| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23495 14:38 |but then people in all integrity see ok well i guess we have to handle the| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23496 14:42 |situation and they move into what i 've discovered as the reactive planning| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23497 14:45 |model what 's that| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23498 14:46 |first approach let 's get busy work harder for people| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23499 14:49 |overtime then you get busy burned-out just % uh people at this thing called| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23500 14:53 |a that is not handling it we need to get organized or reorganized our paper| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23501 14:57 |and then you have spreadsheets and you know net analytical reports sprouting| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23502 15:02 |spontaneously other clothes officers| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23503 15:04 |somebody at some point realize that a well| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23504 15:07 |analyze problem does n't handle the problem well| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23505 15:11 |i guess we need some more creative input but bring everybody together| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23506 15:15 |whatever brainstorming who 's got a good i need right| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23507 15:19 |that does n't work there well we must have used up all over internal| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23508 15:22 creativity xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23509 15:23 |dried up on the last three or well yes we have to get it from the outside| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23510 15:27 |time to hire a consultant perhaps right and if they 're| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23511 15:31 |be you know worth their salt at some point they 're gon na look around they| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23512 15:34 |will excuse me what do folks trying to do here| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23513 15:36 |no wonder we pay this consultant so much money| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23514 15:39 |to straighten us out so folks it 's not a matter of whether you do| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23515 15:43 |the natural model but when and at what cost so why does this happen| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23516 15:50 |why to resist this from my experiences because the greatest human fear| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23517 15:54 |is the fear being outta control and the way that translate on ordinary| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23518 15:59 |day-to-day basis as we really do n't want to be wrong| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23519 16:01 |or make a mistake we hate that any hop into bed this morning so i ca n't wait to| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23520 16:05 |go beyond the company 's jerk today| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23521 16:07 |no week it 's tanner so we| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23522 16:11 |10 did not want to jump into anything we do n't feel like we can engage with| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23523 16:14 successfully xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23524 16:15 |most people do n't trust they know how to play in| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23525 16:18 so xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23526 16:21 |left-wing somebody not our fault it 's missus williams fourth-grade| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23527 16:26 |for me and the state 's fourth grade when we learn to write| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23528 16:30 |you know topical papers inch to write| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23529 16:33 |a really successful paper she taught us| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23530 16:36 |the person we had to do was we had the right on outline the way you do that| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23531 16:40 |his title at the top with major headings major subheadings you ca n't have just| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23532 16:44 one xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23533 16:44 |you have to have to and you can have a little one without a two-unit up three| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23534 16:48 |not one an order that you can have some sub sub headings| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23535 16:51 |i look at that kinda looks great which great looks to me like a man feel about| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23536 16:55 |not begin with to write a great report thanks missus williams| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23537 16:58 |for this key so went home that night to write a essay about my paper topic| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23538 17:02 |prague 's| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23539 17:03 |sat down and froze i do n't think i ever wrote an outline first| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23540 17:08 |i just wrote the report hope that was okay building the outline after the fact| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23541 17:11 |however did that| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23542 17:12 |yes welcome to the basic| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23543 17:16 |unnatural planning model folks| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23544 17:20 |we have got to recondition andy condition that and reframe it| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23545 17:24 |it 's actually easy to do why folks just know that it anytime| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23546 17:28 |because you already know how to do this you can get on topic anything| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23547 17:32 |and create a lot more creative space and take a lot of that pressure of| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23548 17:37 |and do n't worry you 're a natural| xPjgn4BiU3Q
_*23549 17:40 |as long as you decide to be thanks for listening| xPjgn4BiU3Q

_*23603 0:56 |oh , i see . i thought you would n't reveal anything before the presentation .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23604 1:00 |we did n't ! i have only given vague hints .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23605 1:04 |i think he hoped for more .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23606 1:07 |well ? excited ?| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23607 1:09 |yes , a bit .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23608 1:12 |yes , actually a lot .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23609 1:15 |you where always able to calm me down before a show .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23610 1:17 |yeah well , i just distracted you with sex .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23611 1:20 |it always worked very well .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23612 1:24 |i 'm ... i 'm really very proud of you .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23613 1:28 |without you i would never have come so far .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23614 1:29 |that 's sweet but not true ! your talent and your ambitions have brought you to your present success .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23615 1:35 |if you want you can come to the show , too ... .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23616 1:47 |-- that ca n't be true . == what 's wrong ?| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23617 1:51 |that 's my dress !| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23618 1:53 |that 's our final dress for the show . we will present it tonight for the first time .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23619 1:57 |but when you 're gon na show it tonight for the first time , how can it be that this lady is wearing it ?| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23620 2:01 |i do n't know but i 'll find out !| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23621 2:14 |== well ? -- i was right . i know my own designs .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23622 2:17 |== so it 's your dress ? -- well , it 's not mine it 's a copy but ...| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23623 2:21 |== on top of that a bad one ! -- but who makes a copy of your dress ? !| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23624 2:24 |i do n't know ! i have no idea ! one of her friends made it for her .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23625 2:28 |and did she say who ?| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23626 2:30 |no ! she did n't want to tell me the name ... but i also did n't want to beat it out of her here in public .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23627 2:35 |does n't make any sense .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23628 2:37 |do you think it 's one of the sewers ?| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23629 2:39 |i have no idea . i can only hope that nobody gets to know from it !| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23630 2:43 |especially not the press !| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23631 2:48 |i 'll find out who did it !| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23632 2:50 |and this person had better prepare for stormy weather !| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23633 3:12 |i did n't expect this from anybody ... and none at all jessica .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23634 3:16 |i knew right away that it was her who did it !| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23635 3:19 |as soon as she has seen a design she likes she stops thinking , completely .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23636 3:23 |i 'm sure she had not really thought about it .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23637 3:25 |sometimes she 's like a little child in a candy store : she has seen something and wants to have it , immediately !| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23638 3:29 |yeah , and i had to suspend her !| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23639 3:32 |but she would have never realized that she had done something wrong !| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23640 3:36 |probably she was n't careful enough .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23641 3:38 |marlene , she took home a dress from the firm . this is absolutely forbidden !| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23642 3:42 |it can ruin the presentation !| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23643 3:46 |-- does anybody know about this `` copy dress '' , apart from you ? == no ! luckily not !| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23644 3:50 |and i hope it wo n't change ! when it 's published in the press , it was all for nothing ! we would have to start from scratch !| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23645 3:55 |ahh shit ! who 's drinking coffee at the workplace again ? !| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23646 3:58 |rebecca ! relax ! it 's not so bad .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23647 4:02 |do you have a dustpan ?| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23648 4:03 |yeah , get a dustpan , please !| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23649 4:16 |stress ?| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23650 4:18 |-- that 's an understated expression ! == hey !| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23651 4:21 |you always were concerned about if all goes well , and at the end it always was a successful show .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23652 4:26 |yeah , but this time it 's different .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23653 4:30 |ricky pflock found out that somebody made a copy of our final dress . he even took pictures of the woman and showed them at the press conference .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23654 4:37 |this ca n't be true . what did you respond ?| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23655 4:40 |of course i denied that it 's our dress . but we ca n't do the show without it , the people are expecting a highlight at the end .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23656 4:46 |and now tanja wants me to create a new one !| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23657 4:48 |and you should pull it from a hat overnight , or what ?| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23658 4:53 |rebecca ...| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23659 4:54 |the only thing that 's important is that the dress you show tonight will look different from the dress photographed by ricky pflock , right ?| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23660 5:02 |right ! i just have to make some changes . different neckline , length , gathers ... then it could be quite different .| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23661 5:09 |and then this reporter has been mistaken ...| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23662 5:12 |why did n't i come up with this myself ?| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23663 5:14 |thanks marlene !| Zk48Qe84txU
_*23664 5:16 |now i just need a little more time .| Zk48Qe84txU

_*23677 0:00 |hey everyone , today 's video i 'm going to talk| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23678 0:02 |with you about the six signs of depression .| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23679 0:05 |so stay tuned .| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23680 0:15 |so sign number one : feelings of hopelessness| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23681 0:18 |or constant pessimism .| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23682 0:20 |and the reason that this is so prevalent with depression| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23683 0:23 |is because often times if any of you have been| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23684 0:25 |depressed , you know it can go on for a long period of time .| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23685 0:29 |and during that , we think `` is it ever going to end ? oh my god am i going to feel like this forever ? ''| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23686 0:35 |and so that feeling of hopelessness and pessimism about our future is palpable , is everywhere , right ?| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23687 0:41 |we feel it all day . so that 's why it 's so important that if you 're struggling with this| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23688 0:45 |and if you think `` hey i might have some of these signs '' you should seek help . if you do n't already| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23689 0:51 |have a therapist , please reach out and get one . if you have n't already talked to your doctor about this| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23690 0:54 |please reach out and talk to them as well , because the sooner we get ahold of this , the better .| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23691 1:00 |sign number 2 : restlessness or irritability .| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23692 1:03 |and this can have to do with a lot of the other signs that i 'll talk about because we may not be sleeping| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23693 1:08 |well or eating well , and people can just make us really frustrated and piss us off . so we 're really| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23694 1:13 |edgy . everything will set us off .| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23695 1:17 |sign number 3 : now , this is something that we as therapists call anhedonia . but what that really means| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23696 1:24 |in regular people terms is you do n't have an interest or find pleasure in activities that you used to like and find| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23697 1:31 |pleasure in . so if you used to love to paint and now you 're like , ugh , i do n't even want to think about it .| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23698 1:36 |or you used to have a book club you were involved in , or a sport you used to play with people and you no| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23699 1:42 |longer want to participate , that 's the sign i 'm talking about .| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23700 1:48 |sign number 4 : overeating or loss of appetite . now , obviously , this is not otherwise attributed to an eating| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23701 1:58 |disorder . that 's something totally separate . but if you 've always had a regular healthy appetite and now| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23702 2:03 |you find yourself binge eating all day , or overeating till you kinda feel sick , or if you no longer have an appetite| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23703 2:10 |and you had normal eating habits before , it could be attributed to depression and that 's one of the signs .| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23704 2:17 |sign number 5 : suicide or suicide attempts . or even suicidal ideation , like the thoughts of suicide . and obviously| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23705 2:27 |this will have to do with the fact that we 're really depressed and things have been feeling really bad to us lately| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23706 2:32 |and so we may think about ending it all . if this is something that you are struggling with right now , please| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23707 2:39 |please call 911 , go to the hospital , contact your therapist , do whatever you can . because we have to keep ourselves safe .| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23708 2:48 |the final sign , sign number 6 . now this symptom , or these symptoms , are things that we feel in our bodies| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23709 2:56 |because of our depression . and those are aches and pains , digestive issues , headaches . and the way that we know| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23710 3:02 |that these are associated with our depression and not a general medical condition is that we 've sought treatment| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23711 3:08 |for them and they have persisted . so we 've gone to our doctor for the headaches or the stomach aches and they| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23712 3:14 |say everything is fine or they give us some medicine and nothing really helps it , and we still feel it| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23713 3:18 |every day . now obviously these are only six signs and symptoms of depression , and everybody experiences| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23714 3:24 |things differently , right ? but the great thing to know about all of this is that there 's help out there .| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23715 3:29 |we can get better . depression is something that we can fight through , and we can win . and if you have n't checked| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23716 3:34 |out my community and gotten on katimorton.com , we have a great community of people there to help and support| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23717 3:39 |as well as me , myself to answer any questions you have about `` well , i 'm feeling kinda depressed and i want| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23718 3:45 |to set up an appointment but what does that look like ? '' i have videos on that . so make sure you subscribe to my| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23719 3:49 |channel because i put out videos on all sorts of topics that can be helpful while you work through your depression| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23720 3:54 |because i 'm here , our community is here for you , and we 're going to get through this as we work together towards a| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23721 3:59 |healthy mind and a healthy body .| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23722 4:14 |subtitles by the amara.org community| 51vdnwrfsNA
_*23723 4:08 |the convener stewart maxwell : good morning and welcome to the fourth meeting of the education| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23724 4:13 |and culture committee in 2015 . i remind all those present that electronic devices should| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23725 4:19 |be switched off at all times . we do not want them interfering with the broadcasting system .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23726 4:32 |this morning . i also welcome james dornan , who is replacing chic brodie , as he also can not| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23727 4:38 |be here . liam mcarthur is on his way , but he is missing at the moment because his plane| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23728 4:46 |is late . we hope that he will join us as soon as possible after he lands in edinburgh .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23729 4:51 |agenda item 1 is the continuation of our evidence taking on the british sign language ( scotland )| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23730 4:58 |bill . i thank everyone who has submitted evidence to us . we have received numerous bsl videos| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23731 5:09 |and written submissions , and our facebook group now has more than 1,900 members . i thank| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23732 5:21 |in examining the bill .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23733 5:23 |i welcome our first panel . we have alan drew , who is a member of the scottish deaf youth| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23734 5:37 |the british deaf association in scotland ; frankie mclean , social care manager at deaf| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23735 5:42 |action ; and nicola mitchell , who is a bsl tutor .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23736 5:47 |i point out that we have three large panels of witnesses today and a lot of work to get| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23737 5:58 |through , so i will move straight to questions about the bill from members . if the witnesses| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23738 6:18 |the first question is from siobhan mcmahon .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23739 6:26 |siobhan mcmahon : the first question should be nice and easy . is legislation necessary| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23740 6:33 |to promote bsl ? what specific outcomes could the bill bring ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23741 6:46 |heather gray : the bill will bring the opportunity to promote the culture of bsl in scotland| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23742 7:00 |and will ensure that bsl has the status of a language . the bill will have a significant| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23743 7:13 |impact by shining a light on this very important language .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23744 7:19 |frankie mclean : the main thing is that we do not see ourselves as disabled . i realise| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23745 7:35 |that there are a variety of disabilities out there , but we do not consider ourselves disabled .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23746 7:43 |people are confused about what is covered under things such as the equality act 2010 ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23747 7:50 |and many people do not consider deaf people to be disabled and therefore covered by that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23748 7:56 |act .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23749 7:56 |it is difficult to fit linguistic issues into legislation that is designed for disability .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23750 8:04 |the bill is a better model of legislation , as it will promote the use of bsl . that will| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23751 8:14 |provide a better opportunity for us to access the services that we need .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23752 8:20 |the 2010 act is in place , but it does not seem to be successful in respect of deaf people| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23753 8:26 |who use bsl . we are still going to hospital appointments and not having access to communication| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23754 8:32 |support . that is evidence that the act is not successful , which is why we need the bill .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23755 8:42 |avril hepner : we just want our language , culture , heritage and identity recognised , in the same| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23756 8:51 |way as welsh , gaelic and other spoken languages are recognised . we want our language to be| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23757 8:57 |protected and preserved and we want the risk of its demise to be reduced .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23758 9:01 |the bill will protect our language into the future . it will show that we belong here and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23759 9:09 |that we have a spiritual home in scotland . legislation is important to promote and preserve| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23760 9:15 |the language . as members will have become very well aware , bsl is a language . many years| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23761 9:25 |ago , the british deaf association published a dictionary , which provides definitive evidence| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23762 9:31 |that bsl is a full language that needs to be recognised and accepted alongside the other| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23763 9:36 |languages of scotland .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23764 9:38 |nicola mitchell : can i add something about bsl being a language ? it is part of our everyday| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23765 9:45 |lives and needs to be part of the way in which we access services . deaf people are hugely| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23766 9:52 |frustrated and depressed because of the barriers and problems that we face in getting linguistic| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23767 10:00 |access to what is going on . deaf people want an improved quality of life and improved access| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23768 10:07 |to the services that we need .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23769 10:09 |siobhan mcmahon : i understand the points that you make about the language and how it is| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23770 10:16 |important to recognise it as such . however , the bill stops short of defining clear rights| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23771 10:22 |for bsl users or duties on public authorities . is that a limitation of the bill ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23772 10:29 |many people have said in their responses to the committee that they see the bill as a| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23773 10:34 |stepping stone . do you believe that it is ? is that enough at the moment ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23774 10:43 |frankie mclean : we all agree that we would love to have more . we have had years of problems .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23775 10:56 |to be realistic , we would like to grab the opportunity that has been presented to us .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23776 11:02 |it is a first step , but it is a lot better than what we have . i know that some authorities| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23777 11:09 |might be quite concerned and anxious about this , but the bill would be a good and useful| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23778 11:16 |first step to get something on the statute book .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23779 11:20 |avril hepner : we can look at the bill as opening the door for deaf people and our language .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23780 11:33 |as frankie mclean said , it is a first step . the bill is a pioneering piece of legislation| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23781 11:38 |for the united kingdom , so we welcome it with open arms .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23782 11:42 |we are ready to roll up our sleeves and do the hard work to build on the proposed national| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23783 11:48 |plan and on the statements of intent , which have been mentioned , so that authorities have| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23784 11:53 |clear work plans about what will work for us . we are prepared to wait for quality ; that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23785 12:04 |is important . the community has a very positive attitude to the bill and we want to move forward .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23786 12:10 |nicola mitchell : i agree with what avril hepner and frankie mclean said . the bill will be| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23787 12:19 |an important step towards the improvement of services , which will be gradual . things| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23788 12:24 |will build on the bill . other organisations might become involved , and we hope that businesses| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23789 12:33 |will follow suit . it is the 21st century and it is time for us to move forward .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23790 12:38 |heather gray : i agree . it will be important that the national plan has a very clear vision| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23791 12:47 |and can be linked to outcomes . it will be vital that the national plan sets the scene| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23792 12:54 |and that we have in place the right mechanisms to monitor and review the local plans . the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23793 13:03 |national plan must set out a clear vision to help us to achieve what we need to with| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23794 13:08 |the bill . i agree very much that the bill is a stepping stone that all of us welcome .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23795 13:24 |is the bill anything more than symbolic ? it does not provide any more resources , change| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23796 13:33 |anything in particular or provide more interpreters or translators . is it nothing more than a| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23797 13:38 |symbol ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23798 13:42 |nicola mitchell : i hope that the bill will enhance the need for quality interpreters| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23799 13:58 |and more interpreters . universities and colleges need to ensure that their services are accessible .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23800 14:09 |frankie mclean : the convener is right that the bill could be symbolic , but it is a powerful| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23801 14:14 |symbol , which is why we are all here . we are here and we are using bsl face to face with| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23802 14:20 |members . the committee had however many contributions to its facebook page , which is evidence that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23803 14:28 |the bill is a powerful symbol .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23804 14:30 |avril hepner : the convener asked whether the bill is merely symbolic . what it offers is| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23805 14:42 |perhaps a framework or a skeleton that we can put flesh on and develop as time goes| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23806 14:49 |on . i hope that the national plan will cascade down to local authorities , but we need a framework| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23807 14:56 |or a structure for the ideals , aspirations and , eventually , service expectations .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23808 15:06 |the bill is about recognising our language and our linguistic rights , and that is the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23809 15:11 |focus , rather than our disability . that is a pretty good symbolic start .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23810 15:18 |the convener : i have a follow-up question for frankie mclean before i bring in the next| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23811 15:25 |committee member . at the start , you seemed to suggest that the equality act 2010 is not| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23812 15:36 |sufficient to meet the objectives that you hope that the bill will meet . will you expand| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23813 15:43 |on that ? why is the 2010 act insufficient to meet the objectives ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23814 15:52 |frankie mclean : i have a social work background , and i have personal experience as well , and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23815 16:00 |i see horror stories occurring with deaf people every day . people are going into hospital| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23816 16:08 |and waiting for hours or even months without really knowing what is going on with their| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23817 16:15 |treatment , and people are having problems with accessing college courses and are withdrawing| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23818 16:20 |from college education because there is no provision for them .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23819 16:26 |everyday experiences that people take for granted are problematic for deaf people . for| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23820 16:35 |example , some deaf people have got into debt because of a lack of understanding of some| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23821 16:42 |of the information that has been sent to them in written english . some deaf people see letters| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23822 16:47 |in english and ignore them because they do not understand them . those people then get| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23823 16:51 |into debt and their situation becomes more and more problematic . they end up in crisis| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23824 16:59 |before any help is asked for .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23825 17:04 |because of data protection rules , it is hard for people to interact with financial services| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23826 17:10 |and institutions through a third party such as an interpreter or another representative| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23827 17:16 |who acts on their behalf . the 2010 act does not deal with that , and people and organisations| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23828 17:23 |have to find ways of working round it . the 2010 act talks about reasonable adjustments ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23829 17:31 |but they are hard to define . many organisations say that adjustments that might be reasonable| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23830 17:39 |for deaf people are too expensive , particularly when it comes to language issues . the adjustments| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23831 17:48 |that deaf people need are deemed not reasonable . that is a loophole in the legislation .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23832 17:58 |if i want to go to a solicitor , who has to pay for the interpreter ? i do . legal aid does| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23833 18:05 |not cover that . it covers the cost of the first appointment , but not the interpreting| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23834 18:15 |costs . if i want to buy a house , i need to interact with a lawyer . legal aid does not| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23835 18:23 |cover that . what do i do when i want to buy a house ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23836 18:28 |those are just quick examples . i could go on for hours and give the committee some horror| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23837 18:36 |stories of experiences that deaf people have had .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23838 18:39 |the convener : before i bring in nicola mitchell and avril hepner , i will pursue that . i know| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23839 18:43 |that we will get into some of the detail later , but you gave examples of people getting into| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23840 18:50 |debt or trying to buy a house and you said that the 2010 act does not help with those| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23841 18:57 |day-to-day situations . how will the bill help with them ? in what way will it prevent somebody| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23842 19:06 |from getting into debt , for example ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23843 19:18 |ensure that information is accessible in bsl . we also need recognition that bsl is a language ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23844 19:26 |because people do not understand what it is all about . they might not think of it as a| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23845 19:33 |proper language and might consider that it is just people waving their hands around .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23846 19:38 |people do not consider linguistic issues when they think about bsl . the bill would identify| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23847 19:47 |bsl as a language and recognise that the issues for bsl users are to do with language and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23848 19:54 |linguistic access .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23849 19:56 |we also want to celebrate the richness of the language . at the moment , people and organisations| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23850 20:05 |can ignore that . we want to access life through our own language , and legislation that encourages| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23851 20:20 |a change of attitude towards the language and identifies it as a language is necessary .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23852 20:26 |nicola mitchell : i agree with what frankie mclean said , which matches my personal experience .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23853 20:33 |in going to the bank and sitting down with a financial adviser to deal with transactions| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23854 20:40 |that were to do with my house , i had similar problems in accessing the fundamental information .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23855 20:44 |the people there told me that i had to come back in two weeks , because that was when they| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23856 20:48 |could do something , but i needed access to the information right away . i often felt that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23857 20:52 |there were a lot of barriers . it has been difficult for me to deal with those areas| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23858 20:56 |of my life .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23859 20:57 |i faced similar difficulties in dealing with written language and informing people of my| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23860 21:10 |language needs when i visited the tax office website . the fundamental lack of awareness| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23861 21:14 |in those situations means that people often give up . deaf people end up having to do things| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23862 21:19 |face to face , which takes much more time , so we do not have real equality of access .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23863 21:26 |as frankie mclean said , the shift in attitude and culture that will be brought about by| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23864 21:30 |a promotional bill might well help .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23865 21:34 |avril hepner : the equality act 2010 is working for some people , but it is clearly not working| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23866 21:43 |for the sign-language-using deaf community . frankie mclean mentioned reasonable adjustments ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23867 21:52 |whereby services can write things down on a bit of paper rather than provide an interpreter .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23868 21:58 |that means resorting to english and does not give us full access via our preferred language .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23869 22:04 |the bill can state that deaf people should have the provision of services in bsl .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23870 22:09 |we have talked about reasonable adjustments not working . in 2014 , the british deaf association| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23871 22:40 |deaf people .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23872 22:52 |important area of education for deaf children . when we ask msps and mps whether deaf children| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23873 23:21 |means that 92 per cent of those teachers can not sign . how are the children accessing their| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23874 23:25 |education ? how are they setting up the foundations for their wellbeing and their future ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23875 23:29 |we need an act that states that children should be educated in the language and culture to| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23876 23:37 |which they belong , which would give them full access to information . we need a separate| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23877 23:52 |for the deaf community .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23878 23:53 |the convener : committee members have several questions that they want to ask , so i will| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23879 24:00 |bring them in now .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23880 24:01 |colin beattie : some organisations have expressed concern that the bill will use up scarce resources .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23881 24:16 |if members of the panel had a choice , would they spend resources on developing plans or| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23882 24:25 |would they rather that the resources were spent in another way that might more effectively| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23883 24:30 |support bsl users ? it is an open question .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23884 24:36 |frankie mclean : when we talk about spending , we need to consider the fact that the government| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23885 24:44 |currently spends an awful lot on deaf people . most deaf people do not work . although they| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23886 24:50 |try to find work , they do not , so they are on benefits ; they do not actively contribute| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23887 25:00 |to our economy and are excluded from it . an investment now as a result of the bill will| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23888 25:14 |therefore save money in the long term on services for deaf people . if deaf people are able to| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23889 25:22 |interact with the economy and contribute more to it , savings will be made later on in , for| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23890 25:29 |example , mental health services and education .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23891 25:35 |if we do not do anything now , there will be increased costs later on as a result . if we| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23892 25:42 |invest in trying to ensure that deaf people are active members of society and are able| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23893 25:48 |to share their experiences and their knowledge with other members of society , we will all| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23894 25:55 |benefit .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23895 25:56 |heather gray : the bill is timely , as it comes alongside the national sensory impairment| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23896 26:03 |strategy and at a time when there is a focus on the attainment gap for deaf learners . as| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23897 26:11 |frankie mclean said , the bill is a stepping stone that allows us to focus on children| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23898 26:17 |and young people and on a range of issues for deaf people in scotland that will help| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23899 26:24 |support better outcomes for them and enable investment in the future .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23900 26:30 |the timing of the bill is very good in relation to other areas of focus , in particular the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23901 26:39 |attainment gap that exists for deaf children and the issues that were raised in the recent| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23902 26:45 |survey in scotland by the consortium for research into deaf education . the issues that were| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23903 26:47 |raised were picked up earlier ; they include qualifications for teachers of the deaf and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23904 26:54 |consistency of support for deaf learners . there are also issues about timing , the need| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23905 27:01 |for the plans to capture absolutely the right issues and the need to have a real focus on| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23906 27:08 |improving outcomes for deaf children and , ultimately , deaf adults .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23907 27:17 |avril hepner : as has been said , the spending could be a strategic investment for the long| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23908 27:29 |term to save public money . as frankie mclean said , if we give deaf people a quality start| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23909 27:35 |in life , they will contribute .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23910 27:37 |there is a lot of misdirected and unstrategic spending on the deaf community . we would like| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23911 27:47 |there to be cross-department , cross-party joint working so that we target and strategise .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23912 27:55 |there is an awful lot of duplication and repetition of services , for example in the national health| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23913 28:02 |service and other public services , in the context of advances in technology and the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23914 28:07 |increase in online services . such services are not provided in a centralised way , which| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23915 28:13 |could easily work in scotland . we could join the dots between the services so that we would| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23916 28:18 |have a comprehensive , cohesive picture and get value for money for each pound that we| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23917 28:25 |spend .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23918 28:47 |not being spent as wisely as it should be . can she expand on her comments ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23919 29:01 |avril hepner : there are individual , local plans for how nhs services across scotland| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23920 29:14 |will meet the needs of deaf people . i give the example of access via technology to interpreting| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23921 29:19 |services . if we planned things properly in the first place , such services could be provided| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23922 29:29 |in a centralised way rather than pots of money being drained locally . i am sure you would| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23923 29:41 |agree that there would be economies of scale , so such an approach would make sense . does| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23924 29:48 |that answer your question ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23925 29:51 |colin beattie : i think that it does . i understand where you are coming from .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23926 29:58 |frankie mclean : the number of bsl users in different areas varies widely ; in some areas| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23927 30:02 |there are a large number of deaf people , whereas in others they are very few and far between .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23928 30:07 |i am sure that having a centralised system would be far more cost effective .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23929 30:16 |avril hepner : another example that might illustrate the issue concerns deaf children in schools| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23930 30:24 |across scotland . there is an awful lot of expenditure on itinerant and visiting teachers| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23931 30:30 |of the deaf who can not sign very well , as i said earlier . communication support workers| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23932 30:35 |are not trained very well and are giving ineffectual support . if we strategically employed deaf| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23933 30:51 |it would give much better outcomes , which is far more important .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23934 30:58 |as i explained , a lot of the so-called professionals who work in the area do not have the necessary| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23935 31:03 |sign language skills to meet the needs of deaf students . we would like to see a system| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23936 31:18 |bring up our children in the way that they deserve .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23937 31:20 |nicola mitchell : i totally agree with that .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23938 31:24 |the convener : alan drew is here representing younger people today . does he have a view ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23939 31:35 |alan drew : young deaf people often live very isolated lives , in terms of their family ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23940 31:43 |social life and education . they find it difficult to get good employment outcomes ; they are| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23941 31:47 |underemployed and they can not get promotion . i can not emphasise many areas of improvement .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23942 31:56 |for example , job interviews can be incredibly difficult for deaf people to navigate well .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23943 32:09 |often employers and educational establishments have an attitude that is extremely unhelpful| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23944 32:25 |will go a long way to improving that .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23945 32:36 |things should that entail ? what should be included in promotion ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23946 32:46 |alan drew : as was said earlier , promotion of bsl will prove that bsl is a language .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23947 32:56 |hopefully , educational establishments and employers will have an attitudinal and cultural| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23948 33:06 |shift . that is the first key step .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23949 33:10 |promotion can also mean much more of an acceptance of the access needs of deaf people throughout our society .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23950 33:24 |frankie mclean : in my experience , it is not only deaf people who can benefit , but hearing| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23951 33:35 |people too . hearing people are usually fascinated when they are exposed to bsl and very keen| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23952 33:42 |to learn more , but they have a limited choice of where they can go to do that . they are| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23953 33:48 |often disappointed because tuition is not accessible in their locality .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23954 33:53 |i think that having bsl on the curriculum , for example , would improve the awareness of| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23955 34:01 |hearing people . it would improve their language skills , as they too could become bilingual| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23956 34:06 |in english and bsl . that would mean that there would be far more interaction between deaf| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23957 34:13 |and hearing people . hearing people learning bsl would be really useful . it could be fun| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23958 34:17 |for hearing people , and it would mean a lot more interaction and involvement in wider| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23959 34:23 |society for deaf people . promotion of bsl would certainly involve promoting the learning| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23960 34:31 |of it by hearing people .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23961 34:34 |avril hepner : as i said earlier , the dictionary that the bda published a few decades ago recognised| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23962 34:42 |our language as having its own grammar , syntax and structure , which puts it on a completely| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23963 34:48 |equal footing with any other language . we all agree that bsl is a recognised language ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23964 34:56 |and not just gestures or mimes .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23965 35:01 |frankie mclean mentioned the national curriculum . it would be terrific for the curriculum to| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23966 35:07 |recognise the benefits that learning bsl can confer . somebody who grows up bilingual has| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23967 35:14 |many career opportunities , and not only in bsl . they could work as a social worker or| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23968 35:18 |an interpreter within the language group , of course , which would make promotion cost| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23969 35:25 |effective , but bilingualism is good anyway .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23970 35:30 |deaf people have hearing partners and family members ; i do not know whether the committee| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23971 35:33 |knows that more than 95 per cent of deaf children are born to hearing families . if we promote| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23972 35:39 |the language in the wider community , people who have deaf children will be able to communicate| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23973 35:45 |with them on at least a fundamental level . when i think of promotion , i think of the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23974 35:50 |quality of life that the bill would promote .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23975 35:51 |we keep going back to this point , but the principle of changing attitudes and gaining| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23976 35:55 |acceptance and respect for our language on a par with other spoken languages is really| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23977 36:03 |important . it means that deaf scottish people will feel that they truly belong in their| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23978 36:07 |own country .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23979 36:09 |the convener : i ask the witnesses to be brief , as we have a lot to get through .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23980 36:13 |heather gray : i wanted to mention dingwall academy and the one-plus-two initiative there ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23981 36:18 |in which students are learning bsl as a second language . that is perhaps an opportunity ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23982 36:25 |and it is certainly a great example of good practice .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23983 36:31 |james dornan : a number of comments to the committee have suggested that the bill could| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23984 36:41 |have unintended consequences , primarily in the form of a detrimental effect on the availability| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23985 36:45 |of resources to support people with other communication needs . do you agree ? could deaf| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23986 36:51 |people with other communication needs be negatively affected by the bill ? if so , in what ways ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23987 37:03 |frankie mclean : at present , bsl should be an option for anyone who chooses to use it ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23988 37:14 |but in reality it is not an option because of the lack of resources , support and so on .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23989 37:23 |families with deaf children often do not take up the option of bsl . as avril hepner said ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23990 37:29 |the vast majority of deaf children are born into hearing families , who do not know how| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23991 37:35 |to communicate with their child . they do not know where to go to learn bsl , and they are| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23992 37:40 |maybe not advised to do so .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23993 37:46 |deafness covers a broad range of individuals who communicate in different ways , and not| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23994 37:51 |all of them will use bsl . some will lip-read and speak , for example , and that is fine .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23995 37:57 |however , i am thinking about how many of those people would welcome the opportunity to learn| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23996 38:03 |bsl if it was available to them . i am confident that many more people would access bsl tuition| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23997 38:11 |if they were able to do so , because hearing loss can have a profound effect on the lives| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23998 38:16 |of individuals , and the impact on their ability to communicate can cause a great deal of frustration| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*23999 38:25 |and often depression .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24000 38:27 |for example , single parents who lose their hearing have hugely problematic issues communicating| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24001 38:38 |with their children . hearing loss can involve a lot of stress , and people can really struggle| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24002 38:44 |in their individual circumstances . having bsl as an accessible option for more people| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24003 38:53 |to learn would benefit a lot of hard-of-hearing people too , as it would give them another| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24004 38:59 |choice that could help them to access services . the bill could be very positive for other| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24005 39:08 |people .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24006 39:12 |so much about the issues that mr mclean just mentioned in his response . many of us recognise| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24007 39:19 |the benefits that would result if bsl was widely available . the question was directly| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24008 39:23 |about the impact on resources .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24009 39:42 |some of it had to be used , under the legislation , for bsl plans and promotion . i am not confident| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24010 39:54 |that extra money would be provided to do that . the money would remain the same , but some| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24011 39:59 |of it would have to be allocated for promotion and so on . what would be the impact on bsl| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24012 40:06 |users of that ? i am paraphrasing the question .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24013 40:08 |james dornan : i was going to come back in and make exactly that point , convener .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24014 40:12 |the convener : i am sorry . would frankie mclean respond directly to that point ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24015 40:18 |frankie mclean : i am sorry ; i was emphasising the positives and i know that there are concerns| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24016 40:25 |about this . the honest answer is that we do not know but when i consider current spending| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24017 40:32 |on deaf people , i think that there would be a lot of savings . for example , not much is| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24018 40:44 |spent on lip-reading classes at the moment . the spending is the other way around . there| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24019 40:53 |is more spending on bsl users than there is on the other groups of deaf people . [ interruption . ]| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24020 41:05 |that is available right now , there is much more spending on the other forms of communication| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24021 41:10 |than on bsl . that is the status quo .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24022 41:13 |the convener : no . it is not .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24023 41:15 |frankie mclean : no ; i will clarify . at the moment , we are not totally sure what the spending| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24024 41:26 |is on the other communication methods . i do not think that there is that much spending| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24025 41:29 |on them anyway .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24026 41:35 |alan drew : the bsl bill will make bsl needs more visible . i feel that they are not visible| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24027 41:49 |enough within the spectrum of needs and the services to meet those needs .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24028 41:55 |avril hepner : i do not think that there would be any negative effects at all , to be honest .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24029 42:01 |we have to bear in mind the fact that bsl is a language . you are talking about communication| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24030 42:22 |perhaps . there should not really be any negative or unintended effects of the bill . consider| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24031 42:28 |the amount of funding that has been given to cochlear implantation over the past few| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24032 42:39 |to spending in this way . there should be no negative effects at all .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24033 42:43 |we are talking about a distinct language and the other services are for people who do not| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24034 42:52 |use that language . there are two separate issues and it would be good for us to focus| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24035 42:59 |on the language side of things .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24036 43:03 |we talked about the see hear strategy . obviously we are supportive of a wide and open attitude| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24037 43:14 |to the spectrum of deafness and the services for it , but i strongly believe that a bsl| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24038 43:20 |bill would have no negative unintended consequences .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24039 43:24 |heather gray : our organisation is seeing significant cuts in sensory services right across scotland .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24040 43:36 |we need to be aware that financial resources could be diverted from the additional support| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24041 43:47 |that is required for deaf children in the classroom , for example , particularly for communication| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24042 43:53 |support workers , radio aids and improved acoustics . given the situation across scotland just now| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24043 44:03 |and the constraints on budgets , we need to be cautious about that .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24044 44:09 |james dornan : may i come back to you on that point , heather ? do you have any suggestions| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24045 44:15 |about how to mitigate those circumstances ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24046 44:17 |heather gray : yes . some funding could be attached to the bill .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24047 44:21 |james dornan : i had a feeling that that might be your number 1 response .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24048 44:26 |heather gray : i believe that the bill will require funding and resourcing , given that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24049 44:32 |we know that there are inconsistencies and gaps in services across scotland . services| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24050 44:38 |are working incredibly hard to build capacity and to use resources as effectively as possible ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24051 44:46 |but we are seeing significant cuts to budgets and real pressures on councils . my concern| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24052 44:51 |is that it may well be difficult to fulfil the obligations unless financial resources| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24053 44:55 |are attached to the bill .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24054 44:57 |james dornan : should the bill include a specific reference to the needs of deafblind bsl users ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24055 45:08 |if so , in what way ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24056 45:11 |nicola mitchell : yes , i think that it should , because deafblind people are deaf primarily| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24057 45:25 |and then they lose their vision later in life . they are people who rely on bsl .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24058 45:31 |frankie mclean : yes , i think that deafblind communication involves a hands-on , tactile| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24059 45:50 |i am not a linguistic academic , so perhaps other people can tell me if i am wrong about| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24060 45:58 |that .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24061 45:59 |avril hepner : as frankie mclean said , deafblind people are a distinct group within our community| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24062 46:06 |and have their own extra needs . it is important to make sure that they are included . if we| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24063 46:12 |are talking about including the deaf community within wider society , we need to consider| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24064 46:18 |the deafblind minority within the deaf community as part of that picture .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24065 46:23 |liz smith : as the bill stands , there is a proposal that one minister should have a specific| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24066 46:33 |responsibility for bsl . the scottish government has come back and said that all ministers| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24067 46:38 |should have responsibility because of the collective role that their portfolios play .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24068 46:47 |should there be a specific minister with responsibility for bsl ? if so , what additional benefit could| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24069 46:51 |that bring ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24070 46:54 |avril hepner : we would like a minister to be given primary responsibility to oversee| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24071 47:12 |the whole picture and to take the lead on bsl , flowing from an act of parliament . however ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24072 47:20 |in a way , we would like to have our cake and eat it . we would like cross-department and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24073 47:26 |cross-party support for it so that there is a synergy between the head and the heart and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24074 47:32 |the services that are then provided .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24075 47:34 |we would like that strong overview and leadership so that somebody is accountable for bsl , but| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24076 47:39 |we would expect them to delegate those responsibilities across all departments . that would benefit| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24077 47:51 |who is responsible for what . however , we feel that that oversight role is very important .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24078 47:55 |it would also be cost effective . do not forget that we hope to have a national advisory group| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24079 48:07 |that would work in very strong co-operation with all government departments to ensure| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24080 48:11 |that we take the right path in ensuring a better future .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24081 48:16 |frankie mclean : i am sure that committee members have been looking in depth at all the paperwork| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24082 48:26 |on the bill , so you probably have a much more in-depth knowledge about it than other members| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24083 48:35 |of the parliament . it would be invaluable to have a minister who accrues an in-depth| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24084 48:43 |knowledge of bsl , the processes and the needs involved .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24085 48:49 |liz smith : if there is a national advisory body and there is also a minister with responsibility| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24086 49:14 |frankie mclean : a lot of issues need to be discussed and the advisory group would be| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24087 49:31 |and so on . however , the minister is the person who needs to take that overview , summarise| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24088 49:37 |the thoughts of the advisory group and present them to parliament . the advisory group is| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24089 49:43 |where the discussions can take place and feed into the process and that will be done through| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24090 49:50 |the minister .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24091 49:58 |responsibility to set the priorities , would you expect the priorities to come from the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24092 50:07 |national advisory body ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24093 50:08 |frankie mclean : yes .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24094 50:12 |avril hepner : we have talked about the minister taking the lead in terms of parliament and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24095 50:37 |what is going on , so that they provide a link or bridge to the plans and feed the needs| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24096 51:00 |need to be part of the lengthy discussions . however , in terms of formulating a national| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24097 51:06 |plan and supporting authorities to implement it , advisory group members could provide a| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24098 51:12 |vital link between the national parliament and all the services that are being rolled| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24099 51:19 |out across the country .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24100 51:20 |i hope that that is clear . is it ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24101 51:23 |liz smith : yes . however , there must be an expectation that responsibility for bsl will| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24102 51:29 |have an impact on other government portfolios , because it runs across education , health and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24103 51:33 |social responsibility , for example . i am slightly nervous about only one minister having that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24104 51:37 |responsibility , which i think is the point that the scottish government is making . do| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24105 51:41 |you see a way forward in trying to ensure that there is collective responsibility in| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24106 52:03 |the government for the issue ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24107 52:04 |frankie mclean : i am not sure that i can answer that . we can consider how effective the gaelic| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24108 52:08 |model is . if it is effective , we can perhaps follow that model for bsl , but if it is not ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24109 52:19 |we can do something different .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24110 52:23 |avril hepner : to link to what frankie mclean just said , if we spread the responsibility| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24111 52:32 |around , it will perhaps be spread too thinly . we would like to see some sort of accountability| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24112 52:37 |or shared responsibility , if you like . given that this is a promotional bill , one minister| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24113 52:45 |should take the lead over other departments . however , the advisory group would provide| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24114 52:50 |a vital link to local authorities and services . as frankie said , we can look at spoken language| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24115 52:56 |models and see whether they would apply to or work for the bsl situation .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24116 53:04 |the convener : i have a question about an issue that the scottish government raised . the government| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24117 53:14 |suggested that the requirement for listed authorities to publish a plan should be replaced| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24118 53:22 |by a requirement to publish a bsl statement . does the panel feel that a statement would| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24119 53:29 |be better than a plan in driving improvement and measuring progress ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24120 53:36 |heather gray : i think that it is important that there are plans with momentum and accountability| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24121 54:01 |that a statement could be just a tick-box exercise . it is important that , to achieve| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24122 54:17 |progress .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24123 54:35 |how the authority would achieve the outcomes that are laid out in the national plan and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24124 54:41 |how it would drive forward its responsibilities . is there a problem with that model ? do you| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24125 54:47 |have any issues with it ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24126 54:48 |heather gray : my concern is accountability and keeping the momentum going behind the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24127 54:55 |local plans . it is a question of how accountable the local plans are and of how people will| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24128 55:01 |deliver against them . it is critical that the national plan and the national advisory| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24129 55:08 |group are explicit on the responsibilities for reporting back . there is a danger of it| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24130 55:15 |becoming an exercise that does not produce progress . there needs to be some momentum| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24131 55:22 |behind it , and there needs to be accountability for deliverables .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24132 55:25 |the convener : i am trying to understand this , and i wish to probe the point a little bit| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24133 55:29 |more . i understand why you feel like that . you are expressing concern about there being| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24134 55:33 |a statement , as opposed to a plan . i am trying to understand why you think that a statement| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24135 55:37 |would be worse than a plan . you are saying that a statement would be a tick-box exercise ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24136 55:40 |but a plan would not be . however , a plan could equally be a tick-box exercise if you want| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24137 55:47 |to make it like that .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24138 55:48 |surely , if a local body has to publish a statement detailing how it will achieve the outcomes| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24139 55:57 |in the national plan , as long as the national plan has the detail , that statement from the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24140 56:09 |towards the outcomes in the national plan . that is not a tick-box exercise ; in fact ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24141 56:14 |it is quite a focused way of achieving the outcomes that are laid out in the national| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24142 56:18 |plan .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24143 56:19 |heather gray : yes . it is critical that there is a mechanism for reporting back , that there| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24144 56:28 |is a sense of intent and measurable action within the statement and that people can see| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24145 56:35 |a tangible improvement . there have been a number of examples of statements with no intent| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24146 56:43 |and no movement behind them . the important factor is to have intent to deliver the local| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24147 56:51 |plans , and the role of the national advisory council or committee , or whatever it is that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24148 57:02 |is created , is to have some kind of accountability for monitoring that .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24149 57:05 |the convener : i want to be absolutely clear about this point . i will come to other members| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24150 57:09 |of the panel in one moment . the important point is that the principle is to include| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24151 57:15 |intent , monitoring , progress and the publication of outcomes . it is all that kind of detail| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24152 57:22 |that you are concerned about . whether it is a statement or a plan is slightly less important ;| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24153 57:29 |heather gray : it has to have some accountability .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24154 57:31 |the convener : yes . there has to be some solidity behind it , as well as accountability .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24155 57:34 |heather gray : yes , absolutely . having the national task group is critical to that , and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24156 57:39 |it is important to have momentum behind that , so that there is accountability .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24157 57:48 |frankie mclean : the key to the success of the bill is that public bodies should consider| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24158 58:03 |what the issues are for them and for the services that they offer . those will be individual| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24159 58:10 |to the different listed authorities . they need to consider carefully what is involved| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24160 58:17 |for them .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24161 58:17 |those authorities will have the national plan , and they can think about how to achieve the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24162 58:24 |aspects of the national plan , but a statement will not indicate that they are really exploring| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24163 58:34 |the issues as they experience them in their particular fields . it is important that each| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24164 58:44 |authority carefully considers its particular circumstance and what is required in its situation .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24165 58:52 |it must be contextually relevant . it is not about ticking the boxes of the national plan .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24166 59:00 |that can work to a certain extent , but it will be far more effective if there are individual| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24167 59:06 |authority plans .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24168 59:21 |national plan will hopefully make statements of intent with some sort of force behind them ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24169 59:29 |so that the public authorities understand that they need to carry out needs analysis| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24170 59:33 |and to follow what is outlined in the statement of intent .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24171 59:37 |the british deaf association has a bsl charter , which already mentions a great deal of those| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24172 59:44 |things . pages 24 to 26 of the committee papers cover the content and context . the bsl charter| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24173 59:52 |is a statement of intent . police authorities , councils and health authorities are encouraged| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24174 60:05 |in the charter and its aim is that people will work together strategically , to ensure| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24175 60:11 |that the needs of the community are covered .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24176 60:16 |when we talk about a statement , we really want to see a statement of intent . that last| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24177 60:29 |something that exists philosophically and puts it into practice .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24178 60:32 |gordon macdonald : we just heard how important it is to have plans in place . however , we| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24179 60:43 |heard in some written evidence that information on what should be included in a bsl plan is| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24180 60:49 |quite vague and we heard from cosla that there is a lack of clarity . what should be included| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24181 61:00 |in national and local authority plans , so that they can be effective ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24182 61:07 |avril hepner : i could summarise five key areas . the facebook comments and the other evidence| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24183 61:22 |have highlighted that education is key , and the next area is health . social care , particularly| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24184 61:35 |identified gap in services there . the promotion of leisure and inclusion of deaf people in| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24185 61:42 |culture and the arts is the fourth . the fifth area , which is equally important , is employment .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24186 61:46 |we have mentioned before that deaf children need to be able to access their education| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24187 61:53 |in their own language , so that they acquire holistic wellbeing that gives them a sound| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24188 61:59 |foundation for their future . we have talked about interpreters in health services , but| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24189 62:07 |we have growing mental health issues and we do not have competent councillors . the employment| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24190 62:13 |opportunities for deaf people are , as i am sure you will appreciate , woefully inadequate| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24191 62:19 |and behind those available to the general population . those are the five key areas that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24192 62:23 |i would like to highlight .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24193 62:25 |frankie mclean : i totally agree with what avril hepner has just said , but i would add| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24194 62:33 |early years and early intervention . there has to be support for families who have deaf| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24195 62:40 |babies . we need to ensure that they get the right support in the early years , to facilitate| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24196 62:48 |growth , development and healthy lives thereafter .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24197 62:52 |heather gray : in scotland , we do not have a national programme for family sign , which| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24198 63:07 |is vital for supporting the 90 per cent of parents of a deaf child who are hearing and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24199 63:17 |promotes a means of communication in the early years . we know how significant and important| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24200 63:22 |the early years are , so i reinforce the point that the early years are critical in the action| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24201 63:31 |plans .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24202 63:32 |gordon macdonald : avril hepner mentioned five or six key areas that should be included in| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24203 63:40 |national and local authority plans . should more detail on the content of plans be included| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24204 63:46 |in the bill ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24205 64:09 |plan , providing the link between the legislation and the practice . adding early intervention ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24206 64:15 |which frankie mclean mentioned , would give us six key areas . there needs to be a clear| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24207 64:19 |link between those areas and there needs to be prioritisation . we have to think about| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24208 64:24 |this as a long-term , iterative process . the world changes and new issues will come up ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24209 64:30 |and we need to be flexible and adaptable .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24210 64:33 |george adam : the bill proposes that , in each parliamentary session , a performance review| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24211 64:55 |which says :| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24212 65:08 |cosla has said that there could be difficulties with local authorities having to report to| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24213 65:15 |the scottish government on this and it believes that we should go down the community planning| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24214 65:24 |partnerships route . if we did that , how could we get a national picture of where things| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24215 65:33 |lie with the reviews and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24216 65:49 |the outcomes for bsl ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24217 65:49 |avril hepner : that is a good question . you mentioned the difference between formative| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24218 66:02 |improvements . it is important that reviews come from the community , so we need to tap| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24219 66:11 |into local knowledge about what is happening on the ground . however , the answer is that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24220 66:17 |we need both . local performance reviews should feed into a national picture .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24221 66:23 |the bda is working on a participation project in which we consult people and review our| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24222 66:30 |services to the community . that could provide a model for how reviews will work between| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24223 66:36 |authorities , councils and the larger context . cosla states in its submission that it wants| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24224 66:55 |happening , but that they are fed into a national picture .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24225 66:59 |george adam : are you saying that we need to stick with the idea of a national review but| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24226 67:10 |that views should be fed in at the community planning level as well ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24227 67:16 |avril hepner : yes . we need to look at both . the local stuff would be about everyday access| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24228 67:26 |and what is going on on the ground . for that to be effective , it needs to be regular . that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24229 67:31 |is the community planning partnership model that you mentioned , where collaborative data| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24230 67:36 |collection provides material for the reviews .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24231 67:44 |george adam : the only sanction in the bill for an authority that is not performing correctly| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24232 67:55 |is naming and shaming . is that enough or are more sanctions needed to deal with the situation| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24233 68:04 |if the national picture shows that some areas are not delivering ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24234 68:13 |frankie mclean : that is a tough question . sanctions might make people more proactive ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24235 68:29 |but they might lead to people setting insubstantial targets in the first place . if they are worried| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24236 68:39 |about sanctions , they might just make things easier to achieve .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24237 68:45 |it is a balancing act , and the review process needs to allow for that . it would be good| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24238 68:55 |for authorities to be allowed to aim high and fail , but to be supported in that . if| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24239 69:02 |they continually fail , that is when sanctions might need to be brought in . it is a carrot-and-stick| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24240 69:14 |act , but i think that you need to tread quite gently to begin with .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24241 69:23 |george adam : naming and shaming is the only sanction , so that is what would be used eventually| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24242 69:36 |if there is continual non-compliance .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24243 69:41 |frankie mclean : yes , i think so .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24244 69:45 |avril hepner : as frankie mclean said , when we look at how often failure happens and what| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24245 69:53 |support is given when inadequacies have been identified , the focus should be on resolving| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24246 70:00 |problems so that we are looking at a positive way forward when issues are identified . only| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24247 70:06 |when authorities are clearly ignoring or disregarding those should there be some sort of sanction .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24248 70:16 |whether the bill has the strength to do that , i am not entirely sure .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24249 70:23 |the key is to be supportive in the first few instances . ultimately , sanctions will be limited ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24250 70:32 |so they would have to be seen as a last resort .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24251 70:36 |alan drew : we could also look at the best practice or best performance model , so that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24252 70:47 |authorities or organisations that are not doing so well can look to those that are succeeding .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24253 70:52 |that is a constructive , collaborative way of celebrating success and using it as a blueprint| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24254 70:59 |for how other authorities and organisations can improve .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24255 71:03 |the convener : we are struggling for time , so i will have to ask you to be quick .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24256 71:08 |frankie mclean : there are current examples of good practice , but we would like to see| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24257 71:16 |some consistency across the nation . it would not be difficult to model and share those| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24258 71:22 |examples of good practice .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24259 71:24 |the convener : i see that avril hepner would like to speak , but i have a question that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24260 71:28 |follows on from what frankie mclean has just said .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24261 71:34 |the scottish government has suggested that the bsl national advisory group could undertake| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24262 71:40 |collective consultation on authority plans . that is to avoid local or small groups being| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24263 71:50 |swamped by requests to undertake reviews of local plans . what is your view on a collective| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24264 71:57 |consultation process , driven from the centre , rather than more localised consultation by| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24265 72:05 |lots of different groups , with the danger of certain groups being swamped with requests ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24266 72:12 |alan drew : local consultation is good , but we have to consider the potential of people| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24267 72:23 |being oversurveyed and things being missed . the collective consultation has some advantages ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24268 72:56 |initiative is an excellent example of being open and outward facing , as well as being| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24269 73:00 |consultative in a very cost-effective way . the committee will know how many contributions| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24270 73:05 |that initiative has received . we would like to congratulate you on that and to say that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24271 73:09 |it should be an on-going part of the consultation process with the deaf community .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24272 73:13 |local consultations can happen but , rather than making them too onerous , we can tap into| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24273 73:21 |the expertise of organisations , such as the british deaf association . we already have| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24274 73:26 |our participation survey going on . we are doing that outreach work in the community .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24275 73:30 |there is evidence and work available that can feed into the process . there is no need| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24276 73:35 |to reinvent the wheel constantly and there are good , cost-effective ways for the government| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24277 73:41 |to leverage the expertise from our organisations and use technology , through things such as| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24278 73:48 |facebook , to allow that vital local knowledge to feed up into the plans . it does not need| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24279 73:58 |to be expensive , time consuming or onerous . if we are strategic about it , we can have| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24280 74:04 |our cake and eat it .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24281 74:05 |the convener : i have a final question and i am looking for very quick yes or no answers .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24282 74:13 |the timescale suggested by the bill is complicated , so i will read it out :| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24283 74:23 |after the start of each parliamentary session , and that authority plans should be published| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24284 74:28 |no later than six months after the national plan . ( for the first set of plans , the relevant| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24285 74:35 |that to me is a complicated way to do it and i think that the government agrees . it has| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24286 74:39 |suggested a five or seven-year cycle for plans , which is more in line with the gaelic language| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24287 74:45 |( scotland ) act 2005 . what are your views on that ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24288 74:48 |heather gray : i agree that it sounds very complicated . if we have got something that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24289 74:53 |works for gaelic , we should be adopting that for bsl .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24290 74:56 |the convener : does the rest of the panel agree with that ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24291 75:01 |frankie mclean : yes . if it works , use it .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24292 75:06 |avril hepner : i do not have a yes or no answer , but i will be brief . we would like to see| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24293 75:17 |as much achieved in the first session as possible . when you think of the education of deaf children ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24294 75:32 |five or seven-year plans means five or seven years of their lives , and so all their opportunities| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24295 75:36 |could be lost over such a long period . it all depends on which part of the strategy| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24296 75:42 |and service provision we are looking at .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24297 75:43 |the convener : thank you . that has been very helpful . we have gone a little bit over time ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24298 75:49 |but it has been an informative and welcome experience . i thank the panel for their contributions .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24299 75:56 |the committee has certainly got a lot out of this first panel of witnesses .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24300 82:11 |the convener : i welcome our second panel . katy hetherington is from nhs health scotland ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24301 82:18 |nigel firth is from nhs grampian , lorraine vallance is a member of the scottish universities| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24302 82:22 |heads of disability services group , robert nicol is from the convention of scottish local| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24303 82:25 |authorities , and maria dick is from the forth valley sensory centre and is also representing| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24304 82:29 |cosla .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24305 82:30 |we will go straight to questions from committee members .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24306 82:35 |siobhan mcmahon : we heard from the first panel this morning that bsl users feel that it is| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24307 82:46 |necessary to put bsl in legislation . do you agree with that ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24308 82:51 |nigel firth : primary legislation is one option . in discussions with nhs grampian disability| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24309 83:01 |groups , bsl users came up with a range of options that i am happy to put forward . a| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24310 83:10 |voluntary code of conduct or guidance is a second option , and a third would be to reinterpret| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24311 83:18 |or add to existing legislation .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24312 83:21 |as i am sure members know , the general duty in the disability discrimination act 2005| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24313 83:44 |equality act 2010 also contains elements that could be used .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24314 83:49 |the consensus view of our disability groups in grampian , and of those in orkney too , is| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24315 83:55 |that a sensible first step might be to reinterpret existing legislation using the equality and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24316 84:00 |human rights commission in scotland as the primary enforcement body . if that was not| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24317 84:08 |sufficient , primary legislation should perhaps be considered .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24318 84:12 |robert nicol : i probably agree with that . there are a variety of ways to promote anything .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24319 84:21 |primary legislation is one way , but there are other mechanisms out there . i would add| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24320 84:25 |another option to the ones that have been mentioned : there is government policy , which| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24321 84:29 |can be developed collaboratively . we already have the see hear strategy , which i am sure| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24322 84:36 |we will discuss further . another policy , which the first panel discussed , is the one-plus-two| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24323 84:41 |language model .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24324 84:42 |it is clear that there are a variety of ways in which government policy and practice can| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24325 84:47 |be shaped to promote a particular subject . primary legislation is not necessarily the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24326 84:53 |only route to deliver something which , as the first panel made clear , it is strongly| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24327 84:59 |felt is needed .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24328 85:07 |we very much support the thinking behind the bill with regard to promoting bsl , and we| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24329 85:13 |want to see all our public bodies doing that in order to tackle health inequalities and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24330 85:17 |promote equality in access to health services .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24331 85:32 |right to health , and in the human rights-based approach that public authorities could take .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24332 85:39 |by looking at how we could better use those levers , we might achieve the outcomes that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24333 85:43 |the bill is intended to achieve .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24334 85:46 |siobhan mcmahon : in your answers , you have all tended to focus on disability and not| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24335 85:56 |necessarily on language opportunities . frankie mclean on the first panel said that deaf people| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24336 86:01 |do not see themselves as disabled , yet every answer that we have heard from you mentions| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24337 86:07 |the disability discrimination act 2005 and how we can focus on disabled people . do you| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24338 86:16 |think that there is from the outset a problem in your wishing to view the bill in that way ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24339 86:19 |katy hetherington : i recognise completely where the bsl community is coming from on| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24340 86:27 |the point about bsl being recognised as a language issue and not as a disability issue ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24341 86:33 |and i think that the human rights framework might provide leverage in achieving that .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24342 86:43 |non-discrimination is part of the human rights based approach , and the aspect about realising| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24343 86:54 |at the human rights framework more closely in that respect .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24344 87:00 |i can not speak on behalf of the whole of nhs scotland , but i know that nhs greater glasgow| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24345 87:04 |and clyde , for instance , has a bsl plan in place and that action flows from that . other| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24346 87:09 |boards will have similar plans in place already .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24347 87:12 |nigel firth : i quoted the dda 2005 because that legislation is relevant to what we are| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24348 87:21 |discussing . there is no doubt that people who are profoundly deaf from birth are at| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24349 87:28 |a great disadvantage . they are a very vulnerable community , or group of communities . it is| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24350 87:41 |important that every effort is made to expand opportunities and to address issues ; the question| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24351 87:53 |is how we go about that . there are ways other than primary legislation .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24352 88:11 |about the existing support provision that is guaranteed under the equality act 2010 .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24353 88:19 |that is where our concerns lie : the provision might not exist in the bill .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24354 88:28 |lorraine vallance : support might not be available under the bill .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24355 88:31 |siobhan mcmahon : okay . if deaf people are a vulnerable group , i suggest that that is| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24356 88:38 |because we are not listening to what the community wants , and that we define what is best for| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24357 88:44 |the community rather than hearing what they are telling us is best for them .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24358 88:48 |we heard in evidence , and we have seen from written submissions and from comments on facebook ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24359 88:54 |that the equality act 2010 and the human rights act 1998 are not standing up at the minute ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24360 88:59 |particularly in the health service , for which we have had examples . we have been given other| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24361 89:02 |examples this morning , but provision should be made in the health service .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24362 89:08 |katy hetherington spoke about the human rights framework and the 2010 act , but those things| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24363 89:12 |are not being implemented in the way that they should be . a lot of people have said| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24364 89:17 |in written submissions to the committee that the legislation could be implemented properly ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24365 89:20 |but that it would mean going to lawyers and going through a formal process , and they are| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24366 89:25 |not able to do so given the barriers that they already face .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24367 89:29 |do you not see that the bill would , in promoting bsl , help with implementation of the 2010| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24368 89:33 |act and the 1998 act , and would act with that legislation as an add-on rather than acting| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24369 89:36 |against it ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24370 89:37 |nigel firth : it is quite a sweeping generalisation to say that the needs of profoundly deaf communities| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24371 89:47 |are not being addressed by the nhs in scotland generally .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24372 89:58 |would absolutely be a problem if i had said that , but that is not what i said .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24373 90:05 |nigel firth : okay . i stand corrected . it is important to look at what individual public| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24374 90:11 |bodies are doing . some public bodies are exemplary in their provision and others are perhaps| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24375 90:21 |less so . in grampian , we take advice from the local deaf communities . we have involvement| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24376 90:28 |events , and the agenda that we set is their agenda . we do not impose an agenda ; we ask| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24377 90:37 |what we can do to make our services more accessible to those communities , and what would make| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24378 90:41 |life simpler . that is the agenda that we follow .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24379 90:46 |siobhan mcmahon : yes , but the question that you did not address is this : will the bill| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24380 90:53 |add to the equality act 2010 and the human rights framework ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24381 90:59 |siobhan mcmahon : i understand that , but that was my question .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24382 91:02 |katy hetherington : the examples of people experiencing poor access to nhs services are| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24383 91:07 |cause for concern . we hope that it is not the case throughout scotland , but there have| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24384 91:12 |unfortunately been cases in which it has happened . our thinking is around whether we can ensure| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24385 91:19 |that public bodies , including the nhs , follow the equality act 2010 requirements better| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24386 91:27 |so that we can ensure that the needs of bsl users are addressed . we should focus more| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24387 91:34 |on that , rather than developing new plans on bsl . we would like the equality act 2010| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24388 91:46 |and the human rights act 1998 to be used better by public bodies , and we are not sure whether| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24389 91:53 |the requirement to produce an additional plan would strengthen that .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24390 91:59 |nhs health scotland is a national board , and we provide a lot of health information . we| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24391 92:05 |have been reviewing our inclusive communications policy and doing a health and equalities impact| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24392 92:10 |assessment of the policy . we constantly review the requests that we get for bsl translations ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24393 92:17 |and we hope to be responsive to those . i listened with interest to the discussion with the earlier| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24394 92:23 |panel , and we will certainly feed back the issues to our organisation and to the broader| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24395 92:27 |nhs equality and diversity network .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24396 92:30 |liam mcarthur : what the witnesses are saying does not seem to be unreasonable , and none| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24397 92:37 |of us is in the business of wanting to legislate simply for the sake of it . however , as siobhan| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24398 92:45 |mcmahon said , we have the equality act from 2010 , the dda from 2005 and a human rights| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24399 92:52 |framework that has been in existence for as long as the parliament has . although there| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24400 92:56 |are undoubtedly exemplars in the health service , in the education service and in a range of| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24401 93:01 |other public services across the country , the clear message is that the situation is| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24402 93:05 |patchy .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24403 93:05 |the deaf community is telling us that there is frustration that the patchiness exists| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24404 93:19 |than those that are proposed in the bill . the deaf community is saying that the bill| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24405 93:27 |offers an opportunity to identify and symbolise the importance that we attach to bsl . then ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24406 93:34 |through the levers in the equality act 2010 and the human rights framework , we should| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24407 93:40 |start to see a more consistent approach to improving access for the deaf and hard-of-hearing| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24408 93:48 |community . is not that a reasonable proposition for that community to make ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24409 93:54 |katy hetherington : i do not think that it is unreasonable , and i welcome the opportunity| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24410 94:01 |to hear the arguments and discussion on that . we just want to flag up our concern : we have| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24411 94:08 |existing legislation that covers some of the issues , such as equality in access to nhs| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24412 94:14 |services , and it is not working , so will additional legislation that is focused on bsl work in| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24413 94:22 |practice ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24414 94:22 |liam mcarthur : a challenge for us has been to manage expectations about what the bill| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24415 94:31 |will and will not do . we have been wrestling with that . from the evidence that we have| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24416 94:38 |taken so far , it appears that the plans will not be the levers for making progress , but| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24417 94:43 |they will give bsl a status that can then be enforced by praying in aid the equality| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24418 94:48 |act 2010 , the human rights framework and the dda .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24419 94:51 |nigel firth : what liam mcarthur is eloquently expounding perhaps highlights an enforcement| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24420 95:01 |and monitoring issue . i agree that there is inconsistency ; there is a need to ensure consistency| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24421 95:12 |and to enforce the regulations and the legislation that are already in place . i agree that the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24422 95:23 |bill might give a much higher profile to the role of bsl , but it would still be necessary| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24423 95:30 |to step up regulatory mechanisms , otherwise the bill could be enacted but take the debate| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24424 95:41 |about how to meet the needs of the profoundly deaf communities no further forward .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24425 95:48 |colin beattie : i will ask the panel the same question that i asked the previous panel .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24426 95:57 |in their written submissions on the bill , some groups expressed concern that the bill| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24427 96:04 |would use up scarce resources . the convention of scottish local authorities has stated that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24428 96:12 |we are using resources to develop plans . is that the best use of resources or could those| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24429 96:19 |same resources be used to provide better support to bsl users ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24430 96:23 |robert nicol : i will start and other people can come in as they wish . the first panel| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24431 96:31 |clearly desires more services and more support . they want more translation services and more| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24432 96:37 |direct support and access for bsl users . the bill , however , merely creates a mechanism| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24433 96:45 |for establishing plans ; it does not create a mechanism for establishing additional services .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24434 96:53 |that is the issue , as we see it . clearly , as mr mcarthur outlined , there is a need to| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24435 96:58 |manage expectations about what the bill will achieve . it is a balancing act .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24436 97:04 |our clear concern is that , according to the financial memorandum and the scottish parliament| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24437 97:29 |need for promotion and for giving bsl a status that it has not previously had , but that will| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24438 97:45 |lives .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24439 97:46 |james dornan : convener , can i come in ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24440 97:49 |the convener : james dornan has a supplementary . do you have more questions , colin ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24441 97:51 |colin beattie : i do , but if james wants to come in on that point , that is fine .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24442 97:58 |first panel thought that the bill is a very strong symbol in relation to moving forward| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24443 98:05 |with bsl . mr nicol is right that everybody would like more resources for different services :| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24444 98:10 |the first panel made that point . however , nobody on the first panel at any point said| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24445 98:13 |that the money would be better spent on more services than on the bill .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24446 98:19 |robert nicol : we are asking whether investing money in the bill is truly the best way of| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24447 98:27 |getting money for communities and bsl users . we are just outlining an alternative question .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24448 98:35 |james dornan : my point is that the first panel said that they felt that the bill is the best| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24449 98:39 |way forward .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24450 98:40 |robert nicol : i do not want to put words in the mouths of the previous panel members ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24451 98:46 |james dornan : you referred to the first panel .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24452 98:52 |to spend money on . the bill does not deliver translation services ; it allows for plans| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24453 98:59 |to be developed . if you are saying that you want to invest money in translation services ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24454 99:05 |that is clearly not covered by the bill .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24455 99:06 |the convener : i will jump in here to make a point . much of the criticism of the bsl| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24456 99:13 |bill probably repeats criticism of the gaelic language bill when it was first proposed ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24457 99:20 |yet we now have the national gaelic language plan in place and i see that even in my local| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24458 99:32 |has been a change in the mood and in the attitude towards gaelic . people think about it more| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24459 99:37 |and they think about what they should do . for example , when they are changing signage| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24460 99:42 |or producing material , they think about gaelic now . is not that what we are talking about| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24461 99:46 |here ? the evidence about what the bill could do for bsl if it became an act is what has| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24462 99:52 |begun to happen with gaelic .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24463 99:54 |robert nicol : that is entirely appropriate and we are not arguing about the promotional| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24464 100:01 |aspects . i suppose that all we are saying is that we must , at a time of scarce resources ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24465 100:07 |be absolutely certain about what we want to do on bsl . all we are doing here is making| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24466 100:12 |the point clearly that there is a counterargument to what is proposed . it is for the committee| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24467 100:18 |to balance all the issues and make a judgment .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24468 100:21 |the convener : okay . thank you .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24469 100:23 |colin beattie : moving on from that point , what does the panel understand by the term| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24470 100:35 |nigel firth : a basic issue is to ensure that in all areas of scotland we have sufficient| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24471 100:44 |numbers of properly qualified bsl interpreters . speaking for the north-east of scotland , i| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24472 100:51 |can say that nhs orkney has one qualified bsl interpreter and nhs grampian has four ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24473 101:00 |one of whom has not been available to us because of maternity leave . every five or six weeks| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24474 101:13 |there are occasions when we have to rearrange an out-patient appointment for a deaf person| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24475 101:21 |because we do not have a bsl interpreter available . my colleagues and members of the deaf communities| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24476 101:36 |in grampian are concerned about not having sufficient bsl interpreters available .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24477 101:40 |colin beattie : but is that not more about providing a service as opposed to promoting| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24478 101:46 |bsl ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24479 101:46 |nigel firth : it is important to promote bsl , but we need to have bsl interpreters available .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24480 101:52 |we can promote a service , but if we do not have the wherewithal to meet the demand for| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24481 101:58 |it , that is a very serious issue . it is therefore not just about promoting but about ensuring| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24482 102:04 |that we have sufficient bsl interpreters and resources to meet demand . at the moment , there| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24483 102:11 |are issues around that .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24484 102:15 |katy hetherington : having listened to the earlier panel , my view is that the point is| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24485 102:22 |to promote bsl as a language in its own right . that is certainly something that we at nhs| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24486 102:27 |health scotland would do anyway as part of our work on promoting inclusive communications| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24487 102:32 |in the publications that we produce . when we review our policy on that , we will ensure| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24488 102:37 |that our staff are aware that bsl is a language that they are sufficiently trained in understanding .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24489 102:44 |i do not want to speak on behalf of other nhs boards , but i think that staff training| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24490 102:50 |would be part of what they do in promoting bsl as a language .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24491 102:55 |the convener : sorry to interrupt you , colin , but gordon macdonald has a supplementary question| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24492 102:59 |on this point .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24493 103:00 |gordon macdonald : rightly or wrongly , i get the impression that there is wee bit of resistance| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24494 103:04 |to any more legislation coming through . i am keen to understand , given the views of| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24495 103:09 |the first panel , what actions your organisations are currently taking to promote bsl and how| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24496 103:18 |effective that is .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24497 103:22 |maria dick : i can speak about my local area rather than the national picture . we promote| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24498 103:32 |bsl web clips on the falkirk council website . if particular things are happening across| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24499 103:48 |about them . for example , they might be about bin collection times changing , new bin colours| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24500 103:57 |we also offer translation slots . i know that the previous panel talked about not being| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24501 104:05 |able to have bsl interpretation of letters . we have an afternoon a week when people can| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24502 104:12 |bring letters in and have them explained . we have online interpreting locally , and at| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24503 104:19 |a national level the scottish government is rolling out its nhs 24 pilot for online interpreting .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24504 104:30 |it is being rolled out to all public bodies from 22 march . that is something that will| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24505 104:38 |promote access to bsl for all our service users .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24506 104:43 |nigel firth : within grampian , we work closely with north east sensory services and aberdeen| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24507 104:51 |action on disability . we have involvement events , and we do everything possible to make| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24508 104:55 |it clear to members of the different deaf communities that bsl interpretation is available .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24509 105:03 |i think that that is very important .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24510 105:05 |within our own staff , we do introduction to bsl training every year . we have staff who| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24511 105:10 |have reached levels 1 and 2 , not to replace the professional bsl interpreters but to act| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24512 105:19 |as communicators who can greet members of the deaf communities when they come to out-patient| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24513 105:24 |clinics and help to give them reassurance and support .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24514 105:34 |in grampian and on orkney , local deaf communities are aware of the availability of bsl interpretation| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24515 105:42 |services , which we make freely available .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24516 105:48 |lorraine vallance : heriot-watt university now offers a bsl degree . we also have students| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24517 105:58 |studying with us at both masters and phd level . we encourage people to apply for courses and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24518 106:09 |we ensure that they will be supported . we will be looking further at how easily students| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24519 106:19 |can access services .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24520 106:20 |colin beattie : i seem to be hearing from the panel that promotion of bsl is somewhat dependent| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24521 106:44 |is really about access to services and additional services . is that how the panel sees it ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24522 106:51 |nigel firth : i think that promotion means making sure that members of the local deaf| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24523 106:58 |communities are aware that bsl interpreters are readily available in accessing healthcare ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24524 107:06 |and making sure that all members of the communities know that interpretation is there , is readily| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24525 107:10 |available to them and is provided by nhs grampian and nhs orkney .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24526 107:17 |that does not come from the cash-limited budget . we spend whatever we need to spend to ensure| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24527 107:22 |that members of the deaf communities have effective two-way communication when healthcare| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24528 107:27 |is provided .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24529 107:27 |colin beattie : is that not a rather narrow interpretation of promoting ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24530 107:32 |nigel firth : i would be happy to hear what you suggest as an alternative to that definition .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24531 107:40 |colin beattie : i would be happy to hear what the panel thinks about promoting .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24532 107:46 |robert nicol : i think that there are two aspects of promotion . there is the aspect that was| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24533 107:49 |talked about earlier in relation to the gaelic language that tries to build public awareness| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24534 107:54 |and knowledge of bsl as a language . that goes on top of the aspect concerned with how people| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24535 108:01 |access local services and what is available to them , which has now been outlined . those| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24536 108:05 |are the two aspects of promotion .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24537 108:08 |the bill might help with the first aspect , which is public awareness of the language .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24538 108:13 |i think that we have sounded a note of caution about what it does to signpost towards services| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24539 108:19 |and raise expectations about additional services that might follow on from that local promotion .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24540 108:24 |there are those two aspects of promotion . we can clearly see that the bill could be| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24541 108:30 |helpful for one aspect , and it could even be helpful for the other , but only if you| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24542 108:34 |manage expectations about what will actually be delivered in terms of local services .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24543 108:43 |james dornan : a number of people have suggested that the bill could have unintended consequences| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24544 108:50 |for other languages or forms of communication used by the deaf community . mainly there is| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24545 108:55 |concern about a detrimental effect on resources available to support people with other communication| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24546 109:00 |needs . do you have a view on whether the other forms of communication used by deaf people| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24547 109:05 |could be negatively affected by the bsl bill and , if so , in what ways ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24548 109:09 |maria dick : in our area , we have a contract for communication support , which is for 10| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24549 109:20 |hours of interpreting . that covers bsl , hands-on signing , deafblind manual communication , lip-speaking| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24550 109:27 |and note-taking . if we had to take bsl out of that , or deal with it differently , my concern| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24551 109:38 |would be that the economies of scale may not be there and it could become more rather than| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24552 109:43 |less costly for us .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24553 109:44 |james dornan : do you think that separating bsl is a possible result of the bill ? would| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24554 109:50 |it not just be that you would have to monitor it ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24555 109:53 |maria dick : for me , that bit of the bill is not totally clear . the bill is very clear| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24556 109:59 |that it is about bsl , so i am not clear what that will mean for the other communications| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24557 110:09 |support needs , of which there are many . certainly , in terms of our population , there would be| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24558 110:17 |a greater majority in the other group that requires note-taking support or other communication| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24559 110:25 |aids .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24560 110:26 |james dornan : can i just clarify that ? are you saying that bsl plays a minority role| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24561 110:37 |in terms of the services that you provide ? correct me if i am wrong , but the panel suggested| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24562 110:43 |that bsl was the largest part of those services .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24563 110:47 |maria dick : the service that i manage is a cross-sensory impairment service , and within| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24564 110:54 |that the numbers for bsl are the smallest . the percentage of time allocated to it would| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24565 110:58 |be higher , but the number of people needing the service would be lower , because it is| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24566 111:02 |a cross-sensory impairment .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24567 111:03 |lorraine vallance : we have similar concerns . at the moment , we are probably in the unique| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24568 111:10 |position that we have access to funding , called the disabled students allowance , which provides| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24569 111:15 |any support that a deaf student needs , including note takers and equipment such as video cameras .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24570 111:21 |it covers a range of support , and the focus on bsl alone raises concerns for us in that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24571 111:32 |area .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24572 111:32 |james dornan : would you need some kind of security around the fact that resources would| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24573 111:39 |not be diverted from other services ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24574 111:40 |lorraine vallance : yes . those resources are directed at the individual . it is their money| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24575 111:45 |and funding to use in the best way for their communication . we meet with a deaf student| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24576 111:58 |early on , find out exactly what their needs are , and then apply that funding to cover| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24577 112:04 |all their needs , not just bsl .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24578 112:08 |nigel firth : bsl is obviously very important but , for people with acquired profound hearing| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24579 112:17 |loss , lip-reading is also very important . in terms of using bsl , the 3g and 4g mobile| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24580 112:35 |phone technology is very important , especially among the younger users . i often see younger| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24581 112:42 |bsl users holding the phone and skyping or facetiming and signing to each other . it was| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24582 112:51 |suggested that i put forward the idea that some financial support from the scottish government| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24583 113:15 |be welcome .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24584 113:16 |james dornan : okay . i will take you on to another question . should the bill include| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24585 113:26 |specific reference to the needs of deafblind bsl users and , if so , in what way ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24586 113:33 |maria dick : there is a wide variation within deafblindness . the last panel said that people| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24587 113:44 |who are deafblind come from a bsl background . my experience is that many of them are visually| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24588 113:52 |impaired first , and then become deaf , so that their first language would be english . i think| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24589 114:01 |care would need to be taken and it would need to be spelled out as to what part of the deafblind| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24590 114:08 |community was being referred to .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24591 114:10 |james dornan : so you do not see it as a straightforward issue .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24592 114:13 |maria dick : it is not straightforward .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24593 114:16 |nigel firth : we have no deafblind communicator in grampian . we had one deafblind communicator| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24594 114:24 |who has retired and has made it clear that they no longer wish to provide services . when| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24595 114:30 |we require a deafblind communicator , we have to bring them up from the central belt , which| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24596 114:36 |involves a great deal of planning .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24597 114:37 |james dornan : does that suggest that there is a need for some kind of move on highlighting| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24598 114:43 |the importance of deafblind communicators ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24599 114:45 |nigel firth : absolutely , and there is a need for additional training .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24600 114:48 |james dornan : possibly through the bill ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24601 114:49 |nigel firth : through the bill or through whatever other mechanism the committee considers appropriate .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24602 114:56 |siobhan mcmahon : if it is the case that you have to go outwith the health board to find| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24603 115:06 |communicators , how are you meeting the needs under the dda and the equality act 2010 that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24604 115:09 |you spoke of in response to the first question ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24605 115:12 |nigel firth : by bringing up a deafblind communicator from the central belt .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24606 115:16 |siobhan mcmahon : how long does that take for the user ? what happens if their health service| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24607 115:20 |appointment is an emergency ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24608 115:22 |nigel firth : it can take several days . it depends on the availability of the deafblind| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24609 115:29 |communicator .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24610 115:29 |siobhan mcmahon : if there is an emergency health situation and everyone is stressed ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24611 115:34 |do you think that it is acceptable to have to wait several days for an interpreter ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24612 115:40 |nigel firth : nobody waits days for emergency treatment .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24613 115:43 |siobhan mcmahon : so you would just go without the interpreter in that case .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24614 115:48 |nigel firth : it would be a clinical decision . in such circumstances , there can be assistance| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24615 115:55 |from family members , but our preferred option , if there is time and if circumstances allow| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24616 116:04 |it , is to bring a deafblind communicator to grampian .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24617 116:10 |the convener : does not that highlight the problem with the equality of access that we| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24618 116:19 |work so far on the bill ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24619 116:21 |nigel firth : what it highlights is the need for training . i would like the degree courses| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24620 116:28 |that operate to train bsl interpreters to be fully funded , and i would like the individuals| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24621 116:36 |who are undertaking those courses to be salaried during the course of their training , in the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24622 116:43 |same way that nurses in training are salaried . if there was a guaranteed minimum income for| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24623 116:58 |would get more people coming forward to be trained as bsl interpreters and deafblind| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24624 117:09 |communicators .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24625 117:10 |the convener : are you saying that you currently have a vacancy , or vacancies , both for bsl| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24626 117:16 |interpreters and for deafblind communicators ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24627 117:17 |nigel firth : no , we do not employ deafblind communicators or bsl interpreters . of the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24628 117:25 |ones that we access in grampian , three are freelance and we have a service-level agreement| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24629 117:31 |with each of those three individuals , and the fourth person works for north east sensory| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24630 117:37 |services and we access that person through north east sensory services . there are four| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24631 117:42 |interpreters in grampian , and that is how we ensure that we have access to them .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24632 117:47 |the convener : are you currently advertising for a deafblind interpreter and trying to| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24633 117:54 |find somebody in the area ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24634 117:55 |nigel firth : we have tried to find somebody . we know that the previous individual is not| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24635 118:02 |available , and that is why we summon up a deafblind communicator from the central belt .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24636 118:08 |the convener : maybe my question was not clear . i understand that the person whom you have| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24637 118:11 |used in the past is currently unavailable . what are you doing to pursue a replacement| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24638 118:19 |for that person locally in the grampian area ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24639 118:22 |nigel firth : there is no replacement in the grampian area . we have asked all the various| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24640 118:30 |agencies and have sought far and wide . there is no one in grampian who can fulfil that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24641 118:35 |role .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24642 118:43 |the convener : okay . thank you .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24643 118:45 |liam mcarthur : before i turn to the issue of ministerial responsibilities , i would like| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24644 118:50 |to pick up on a comment made by maria dick about the use of english and the development| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24645 118:57 |of sight loss and hearing loss .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24646 119:01 |maria dick referred to publications that are produced and lorraine vallance mentioned note-taking| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24647 119:09 |support . it struck me that we are talking about bsl as a verbal language . what predominantly| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24648 119:18 |is the written language of most users of bsl in scotland ? is it english ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24649 119:30 |maria dick : bsl is a visual language , not a written language . in terms of service delivery ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24650 119:40 |it comes within communication support .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24651 119:42 |incidentally , with reference to some of the difficulties that have been experienced in| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24652 119:48 |grampian in getting deafblind communicators , our greatest difficulty in the falkirk area| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24653 120:03 |from an english-language background and have lost their hearing . there is no course for| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24654 120:09 |lip-speakers in scotland at the current time , and that area is much more difficult for us .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24655 120:15 |liam mcarthur : moving on to the issue of ministerial responsibilities , the bill mentions having| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24656 120:21 |a dedicated minister responsible for bsl . the scottish government has expressed some| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24657 120:27 |anxieties around that , pointing to collective responsibility , albeit that the responsibility| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24658 120:35 |for the national plan would fall within a particular portfolio and therefore under a| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24659 120:40 |specific minister .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24660 120:49 |be a positive or necessary requirement under the bill . if so , what should the specific| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24661 120:56 |responsibilities of that minister be , beyond the development of the national plan ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24662 121:06 |of view regarding collective responsibility across portfolios . we have a minister with| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24663 121:11 |responsibility for languages at the moment , so there is a potential logical home for bsl| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24664 121:16 |within his portfolio . however , we do not have a strong view as to whether there should be| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24665 121:25 |clear responsibility given to one minister .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24666 121:28 |we will probably have some discussion later about what goes in the national plan , which| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24667 121:39 |that we have a language minister at the moment .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24668 121:45 |katy hetherington : i agree with that . we do not have a strong view on the point .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24669 121:48 |liam mcarthur : the government has also proposed the idea of a national advisory group or body ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24670 121:57 |made up of ministers , cosla representatives and representatives of the deaf community .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24671 122:04 |the latter have indicated general support for that , while stressing the importance of| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24672 122:10 |ensuring that the group as a whole has a majority from within the deaf community . do you have| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24673 122:17 |any comments on the desirability or effectiveness of such a group and on the balance of its| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24674 122:25 |membership ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24675 122:27 |robert nicol : the relationship between the advisory group and the national plan is important .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24676 122:35 |it would be helpful to have a national plan that is developed in a consultative way that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24677 122:45 |engages with everybody involved in the bsl community and with service providers . our| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24678 122:55 |strong preference is to develop things on a joint basis , and to do so in as joined-up| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24679 123:03 |a way as possible .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24680 123:05 |the membership of the advisory group would clearly need to represent everyone involved .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24681 123:12 |it is potentially quite a large group , and it is not without its operational challenges ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24682 123:18 |but if there is to be a national plan , there is at least a logic to having an advisory| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24683 123:27 |be in the national plan and how it might relate to local plans under the proposed legislation .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24684 123:32 |liam mcarthur : do we need to be alive to the risk of the group getting so big as to be| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24685 123:39 |almost unmanageable ? is there a case for saying that the national advisory group should have| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24686 123:49 |the scope to assign bits of work and input to others who might not necessarily sit on| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24687 123:56 |the group on a standing basis ? is that a model that might work ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24688 124:00 |robert nicol : that sort of model works well within government . having a sub-group , or| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24689 124:06 |whatever you want to call it , is pretty tried and tested in civil service practice . i do| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24690 124:11 |not think that that would be difficult .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24691 124:13 |liam mcarthur : to be clear , there would not be resistance to the proposition from the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24692 124:17 |bsl community that , whatever the configuration or size of the group , they , as service users ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24693 124:24 |would have a majority on it .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24694 124:27 |robert nicol : others can speak for themselves . clearly , we would need to know the exact remit| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24695 124:33 |of the group and what it is there to do . once we have that , the membership would follow| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24696 124:38 |the function of the group . clearly , it must be representative of all the interests around| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24697 124:45 |the table , and we would make a judgment on that once we see the detail . i do not think| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24698 124:49 |that we can go further than that at this time .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24699 124:53 |liam mcarthur : representatives of service providers will all have official titles and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24700 124:58 |job functions that provide a persuasive case as to why they should be on the group . i suspect| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24701 125:03 |that it might be a greyer area for service users . unless we accept the principle that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24702 125:10 |there should be an in-built majority of service users , there is a risk that it would be easier| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24703 125:23 |for a service provider to justify membership than it would be for a service user . is that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24704 125:27 |concern fair ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24705 125:27 |robert nicol : i can accept that line of argument . all that i am saying is that a potentially| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24706 125:33 |large group of people will be around the table , and there is a discussion to be had about| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24707 125:37 |the principle of whether there should be a majority of bsl users on the group . we have| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24708 125:47 |a stronger view on the national structures that might be set up and how they might relate| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24709 125:53 |to local structures , and what the flow of information between them would be . if a national| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24710 125:58 |group were to be set up , we would have to look at exactly what its function would be .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24711 126:03 |i accept your line of reasoning , but we would have to look at everything in the round , once| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24712 126:12 |we had the detail .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24713 126:14 |the convener : i do not know whether you were in the room for the session with the first| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24714 126:24 |instead of publishing a plan , listed authorities should publish a statement , which would set| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24715 126:32 |out how each authority intended to make progress towards priorities identified in the national| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24716 126:45 |nigel firth : it could be either/or , provided that it fulfilled the primary function , which| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24717 126:49 |would be to give bsl the appropriate recognition and provision that it requires across bodies| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24718 126:57 |in scotland . it would be for the committee to decide which would be the best option .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24719 127:03 |the vehicle might be equality outcomes , which all public bodies in scotland are required| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24720 127:11 |to produce under the equality act 2010 ( specific duties ) ( scotland ) regulations 2012 , which| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24721 127:19 |are due to be updated in april . there are a number of vehicles , and it would be for| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24722 127:26 |the committee to decide which would be the most appropriate .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24723 127:32 |katy hetherington : a statement could be symbolic for how the bsl community wants to see its| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24724 127:42 |language recognised and it could set out what an authority plans to do to ensure that it| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24725 127:57 |pay statements , which set out what an organisation will do to close the pay gap . a statement| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24726 128:02 |could follow something like that ; alternatively , it could be much more worked-up , with outcomes| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24727 128:10 |attached to it . there are various ways in which it could work .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24728 128:25 |we are saying that we are committing to , whether that is in a plan or a statement . a statement| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24729 128:33 |would probably suggest an intent to deliver something , whereas a plan might suggest that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24730 128:41 |there is something a little more detailed behind it , so the language might be important .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24731 128:46 |i can understand why the speakers on the first panel would err towards a plan rather than| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24732 128:51 |a statement , but the heart of the matter is what the document contains , and that is where| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24733 128:56 |our questions lie .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24734 128:58 |lorraine vallance : guidance would be needed on what it would contain before we could decide| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24735 129:03 |whether a plan or a statement would be best .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24736 129:07 |gordon macdonald : i will ask the same questions about what should be contained in the plans| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24737 129:19 |as i asked the earlier panel . cosla has said that there is a lack of clarity around the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24738 129:29 |expected content of the national plan and another written submission said that it was| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24739 129:34 |quite vague .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24740 129:36 |the first panel highlighted six key areas in which it wanted a certain level of service| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24741 129:44 |to be specified and measurable outcomes . i am keen to understand what the current panel| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24742 129:50 |thinks should be included in the national and authority plans , so that they can be as| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24743 129:59 |effective as possible .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24744 130:00 |robert nicol : again , that is a fundamental question and i do not think that i have an| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24745 130:06 |answer to it . the previous panel talked about education , health , social care , leisure , employment| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24746 130:21 |are not covered by that . in education , for example , as i know something about that , the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24747 130:33 |issue for us is what additional services the national or local plan for education would| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24748 130:41 |unlock that are not being delivered now , and how those would be funded or resourced , not| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24749 130:45 |just in terms of money , but in terms of staff time and being able to get suitably trained| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24750 130:49 |and qualified people .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24751 130:50 |the question for us is whether the plans would be a re-articulation of what is already out| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24752 130:56 |there , albeit with greater prioritisation and perhaps promotion , or whether they are| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24753 131:03 |about unlocking new resources to go into new service delivery . if it is the latter , we| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24754 131:10 |are talking about a different sort of legislation that would inevitably need to have further| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24755 131:19 |funding to allow it to be delivered properly .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24756 131:21 |katy hetherington : for the health service , the plans would be on equity of access , which| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24757 131:43 |and communication support for patients .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24758 131:46 |gordon macdonald : there has been a suggestion , including from mr nicol , that the preparation| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24759 131:50 |of plans will divert funds from other areas that currently support the bsl community .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24760 131:57 |is there an estimate of what the additional costs would be for your organisations ? have| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24761 132:02 |you calculated the potential additional cost ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24762 132:35 |money will come from . will the costs be met from existing budgets or through funding from| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24763 132:41 |the scottish government ? if they were met from existing budgets , that would put pressure| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24764 132:46 |on something , and a choice would have to be made about whether the money should come from| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24765 132:49 |outside the sensory impairment budget or from within it . that would have to be weighed up .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24766 132:57 |the concern for us is that , if there is no additional funding and there are additional| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24767 133:05 |responsibilities to comply with , that could divert resources from elsewhere .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24768 133:12 |george adam : i will ask a similar question to the one that i asked the previous panel .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24769 133:24 |the performance review provision is all about sharing best practice and ensuring that we| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24770 133:31 |deliver everything that we want to do . in each parliamentary session , the scottish ministers| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24771 133:37 |will have to undertake a performance review of authority plans , which should include an| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24772 133:41 |account of measures taken and outcomes attained . many of the organisations that are involved| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24773 133:47 |think that the performance review is a good mechanism for holding public authorities to| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24774 133:54 |account , but cosla felt that it| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24775 134:00 |you explain that , mr nicol ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24776 134:02 |robert nicol : the heart of the issue is that local government is not accountable to the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24777 134:07 |scottish government . we argue that if there is to be enhanced accountability for service| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24778 134:16 |delivery , it should be to local communities . we heard a little about that earlier . we are| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24779 134:22 |not saying that there is not a potential need for national planning and co-operation , but| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24780 134:29 |we have the ability to translate national priorities into what happens locally , through| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24781 134:36 |single outcome agreements , for example . there are mechanisms for translating a national| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24782 134:44 |sense of direction into what happens locally . we are concerned about the language of performance| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24783 134:56 |review . who will performance review the local plans ? who will make a judgment as to whether| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24784 135:02 |a plan is fit for purpose ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24785 135:03 |the bill could cover a range of services , one of which is education . we already have| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24786 135:11 |structures for education through which independent scrutiny is brought to bear on service delivery .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24787 135:17 |we have other forms of performance appraisal within authorities as well as externally ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24788 135:25 |through organisations such as the care inspectorate , so what additional structures will we create| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24789 135:31 |for the purpose of the bill ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24790 135:38 |the question for us is : where is it most appropriate for accountability to lie ? if there is to| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24791 135:45 |be enhanced accountability to bsl users , it should be at the local level , not necessarily| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24792 135:55 |at the national level , albeit that there are mechanisms that , to some extent , give us a| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24793 136:01 |bit of the best of both worlds .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24794 136:03 |george adam : however , the bsl performance reviews are for the parliament to hold the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24795 136:07 |scottish ministers to account and ministers to hold to account listed authorities , which| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24796 136:12 |would include local authorities . basically , the bill would give everyone the opportunity| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24797 136:20 |to be open and democratic .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24798 136:23 |being a former councillor , i know how community planning partnerships work . the british deaf| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24799 136:30 |association scotland is concerned to ensure that performance review is not just a simple| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24800 136:35 |box-ticking exercise but that best practice is shared . if we kept everything at a local| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24801 136:44 |level , how could we get a national picture of how things are going ? we are all accountable| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24802 136:49 |for ensuring that the bill makes a difference .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24803 136:53 |robert nicol : there is a difference between , on the one hand , getting a national picture| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24804 136:57 |and , on the other , ensuring a direct line of accountability for delivery and making| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24805 137:03 |a judgment as to whether a body has succeeded in service delivery .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24806 137:10 |there are ways of getting a national picture of certain aspects of whatever strategy is| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24807 137:17 |implemented and we can choose how to report on that . our concern lies with how a national| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24808 137:31 |organisation such as the scottish government would appraise the performance of local organisations| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24809 137:36 |such as local authorities on something for which they are closest to the community and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24810 137:44 |the services that it receives . in effect , we would be second guessing who knows best .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24811 137:48 |all that we are doing is flagging that up as a concern for us .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24812 137:56 |george adam : the british deaf association scotland says that a national performance| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24813 138:02 |review would give| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24814 138:07 |it serves . authorities would thus become accountable to the bsl community to ensure engagement ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24815 138:15 |should we not all embrace that and find ways to break down the barriers so that we can| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24816 138:23 |all work to deliver it ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24817 138:25 |robert nicol : we are not arguing against enhanced local accountability so that local people ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24818 138:33 |whether bsl users or people with another sensory impairment , can access services , have a genuine| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24819 138:43 |say about the services that they receive and play their part in their local processes .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24820 139:10 |local decision making , who will make a judgment on whether performance has not been as successful| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24821 139:21 |as we would like and what will happen after that . that is the concern that we are flagging| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24822 139:28 |up .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24823 139:28 |george adam : robert , i am just trying to get my head around the matter . the first panel| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24824 139:34 |of witnesses said that the limited sanctions listed in the bill are , in effect , only to| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24825 139:48 |an issue , instead we should go into the area and try to work together to ensure that things| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24826 139:56 |are working . with the best will in the world , are we not being a bit paranoid about the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24827 140:02 |situation ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24828 140:03 |robert nicol : i would not say that we are being paranoid . we are an organisation that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24829 140:08 |represents local authorities and all that we stressing is the importance of local accountability .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24830 140:14 |if there is to be a sanction , it should be a sanction by the local community on the local| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24831 140:21 |authority through mechanisms that already exist or could be established .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24832 140:27 |we would have a big concern about a national organisation imposing a sanction on a local| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24833 140:36 |authority , and about making a judgment that that is indeed the correct thing to do . that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24834 140:42 |is a very consistent thing for cosla to argue . it does not apply only in this area and not| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24835 140:52 |in others . there needs to be a real and strong connection at the local level between communities| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24836 140:57 |and those who deliver services on their behalf .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24837 141:04 |nigel firth : the situation within health is different , because health boards are already| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24838 141:09 |subject to thorough annual reviews in the annual review process . i see no reason why| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24839 141:19 |the needs of the local deaf communities and bsl requirements could not become an integral| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24840 141:26 |part of that annual review process . as part of the review process , the minister and the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24841 141:33 |team that is undertaking the review meet local people . it would be quite possible to include| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24842 141:39 |local bsl users in the formal meetings process so that there could be an assessment of whether| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24843 141:48 |their needs were being met .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24844 141:50 |however , i would not see that process replacing the routine , on-going involvement of the local| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24845 142:00 |deaf communities to find out how well services are being provided and to ascertain their| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24846 142:04 |needs . that would continue , but the annual review would be a good opportunity for external| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24847 142:10 |scrutiny of how well those needs are being met .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24848 142:14 |lorraine vallance : we already have duties under equality mainstreaming . i would not| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24849 142:22 |see a difficulty with expanding that to include what benefits we had brought in this area .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24850 142:31 |the convener : so it could be covered under the current structure that you have in place .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24851 142:35 |lorraine vallance : yes .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24852 142:36 |the convener : okay . i have a final question about the timescales . i will not read out| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24853 142:41 |the provision again , but the plan must be published six months after the start of a| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24854 142:46 |parliamentary session , or 12 months after in the case of the first one . what is your| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24855 142:49 |view on the timescales that are proposed in the bill for publication of the national plan ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24856 142:55 |robert nicol : our view is that what is set out is quite complex . there is the initial| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24857 143:04 |complexity of fitting in with local elections and things like that , which have slightly| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24858 143:09 |different timescales from parliamentary elections . if there is a way of simplifying that , perhaps ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24859 143:16 |as suggested , along the lines of the system under the gaelic language ( scotland ) act 2005 ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24860 143:20 |we would want to look at that .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24861 143:27 |i accept and can understand the point that was made about wanting to see progress , but| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24862 143:30 |what is outlined in the bill seems quite complex .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24863 143:33 |the convener : as there are no further questions , i thank you for coming along this morning .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24864 143:39 |we appreciate your taking the time to be here with us to help us to examine the british| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24865 143:44 |sign language ( scotland ) bill .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24866 143:46 |i suspend the meeting briefly to allow the next panel to come to the table .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24867 152:47 |the convener : i welcome our third and final panel : carly brownlie , from the scottish association| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24868 152:56 |of sign language interpreters ; clark denmark , who is a bsl broadcaster and former academic ;| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24869 153:00 |professor rob dunbar , chair of celtic languages , literature , history and antiquities at the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24870 153:05 |university of edinburgh ; and professor graham turner , chair of translation and interpreting| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24871 153:11 |studies , heriot watt university .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24872 153:18 |interpretation will be provided through the headsets . bsl interpretation will also be| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24873 153:26 |provided . anyone in the public gallery who wishes to use the headset for the gaelic-to-english| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24874 153:31 |translation should set their headphones to channel 1 .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24875 153:34 |if we all ready , we will start with questions from siobhan mcmahon .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24876 153:41 |siobhan mcmahon : is legislation necessary to promote bsl and what specific outcomes| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24877 153:50 |and improvements will| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24878 154:03 |the bill deliver ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24879 154:05 |professor graham h turner : i just want to let you know that i will sign for only a couple| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24880 154:10 |of sentences . i am a bsl user , but in respect of the fact that your first and preferred| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24881 154:14 |language is english , i will switch back to using english . sometimes the deaf community| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24882 154:27 |for both sides , i will switch from british sign language back to my first language , which| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24883 154:32 |is english .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24884 154:32 |professor turner continued in english . thank you for allowing me to do that , and thank| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24885 154:37 |you for the question .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24886 154:38 |we have heard enough to know that there is a pretty strong view that the existing legislation| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24887 154:47 |is not meeting the aspirations and needs of the deaf community . as i said in my written| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24888 154:56 |evidence , this is not a new issue ; it is a long-standing issue . since at least 1880 ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24889 155:02 |the deaf community has been saying in the uk and in other countries that access to education| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24890 155:10 |in sign language is an absolute necessity for the community and that many other aspects| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24891 155:17 |of society follow from that . the conference in 1880 that banned the use of sign language| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24892 155:23 |in deaf education set the tone for social provision across the board . we have had disability| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24893 155:30 |legislation of many kinds since the second world war , but although it has been understood| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24894 155:33 |in the uk since the 1970s that british sign language is a real and proper language , we| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24895 155:44 |are still discussing the problems that the community faces .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24896 155:50 |as colleagues have said , the facebook evidence from the community has shown clearly that ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24897 155:57 |despite the committee being told in other evidence that provision is in place and that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24898 156:01 |the existing legislation can serve needs , it is not working . something a little bit| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24899 156:07 |different is required . the bill serves that purpose by creating a clarity of focus on| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24900 156:14 |british sign language as a language . it is not a disability issue or a deaf communication| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24901 156:20 |issue ; it is simply a linguistic minority issue , and the bill affords us the opportunity| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24902 156:26 |to deal with it in such terms .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24903 156:31 |clark denmark : to add to what graham turner has said , the deaf community has had a very| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24904 156:40 |long wait .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24905 156:42 |edinburgh should be very proud , because the first deaf school in the world was established| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24906 156:55 |sign language is not a modern phenomenon , and the research bears that out . back then ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24907 157:00 |the children were educated in sign language and in english , with the aim of helping them| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24908 157:06 |to integrate into society , but the best way for deaf people to access english is through| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24909 157:12 |bsl . we have more than 180 years of history here in this city .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24910 157:20 |this country has the potential to do what the bill sets out to do . the british deaf| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24911 157:33 |on the use of bsl in education . there have been countless manoeuvres since then to change| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24912 157:39 |all that .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24913 157:41 |since 1889 , we have not had anything clear about service provision in the area of education .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24914 157:52 |graham turner mentioned the milan conference in 1880 , one of the resolutions of which banned| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24915 157:57 |sign language . that has had a huge knock-on effect . the royal commission in britain was| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24916 158:01 |very much swayed by those arguments , and that has led to many of the problems that are experienced| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24917 158:09 |there has almost been the view that british sign language is an inconvenience , yet despite| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24918 158:17 |all the barriers , prejudice and oppression , it has shown itself to be a strong , vibrant| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24919 158:22 |language that survives . it survives for a reason . there were members of the second panel| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24920 158:27 |who said that we have provision , but that provision is clearly not working . the first| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24921 158:33 |panel illustrated the failures . i congratulate the scottish parliament on at least opening| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24922 158:39 |the dialogue and taking the lead in the uk . the deaf community is delighted by this move .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24923 158:46 |carly brownlie : i support the comments of clark denmark and professor turner . i am here| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24924 158:52 |to represent sasli . the second panel seemed to look at bsl as a disability issue . we want| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24925 159:01 |to remove that view altogether . bsl is a language , a culture and an identity ; it is an expressive| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24926 159:09 |way of expressing themselves for people who grow up deaf . it also allows us to access| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24927 159:15 |information . we do not rely on sound at all ; we use a visual language .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24928 159:19 |the new law that the bill proposes would encourage everyone to see bsl as part of our lives rather| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24929 159:29 |than as a tool or something that is added on to our lives ; it is part of us . i think| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24930 159:33 |that the bill will really help with that and take a lead on that .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24931 159:36 |siobhan mcmahon : as has been said , our previous witnesses suggested that , if we were only| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24932 159:46 |to implement the equality act 2010 or do a bit more on the human rights framework , we| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24933 159:50 |would achieve the same outcomes as we would by implementing primary legislation . do you| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24934 160:00 |agree with that view ? if not , why not ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24935 160:07 |professor turner : the other legislation that has been referred to today is not about to| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24936 160:20 |existing legislation and help to ensure that existing legislation maintains a clear focus| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24937 160:27 |on bsl , alongside the other issues that it deals with .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24938 160:33 |earlier , the committee talked about the number of bsl users , the number of lip-speakers that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24939 160:38 |are required and so on . the census showed that there are approximately 12,500 bsl users| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24940 160:46 |in scotland , but nobody in this room can tell you how many of those people are deaf . nobody| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24941 160:53 |knows that . when it comes to knowing what provision is required for the bsl-using community ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24942 161:01 |we are starting from a poor basis . in that context , it becomes easy for the requirements| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24943 161:07 |to support that community to be backgrounded , because we know about other communities . we| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24944 161:13 |know the number of people with a visual impairment , we know the number of people who use makaton| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24945 161:21 |and so on , but no statistics are available on the number of bsl users who are deaf . that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24946 161:29 |means that it is easy for bsl issues to be clouded , lost and pushed to the back of the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24947 161:37 |queue . the bill is designed to bring those issues to the foreground , when appropriate ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24948 161:45 |alongside the other issues that existing legislation should be able to handle .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24949 161:51 |professor rob dunbar : first , thank you for the opportunity to come to this meeting and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24950 162:06 |for the opportunity to use gaelic as part of the evidence that i am giving .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24951 162:13 |i agree that legislation is essential . from the point of view of gaelic users , the gaelic| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24952 162:23 |language ( scotland ) act 2005 has made a big difference with the development of policies| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24953 162:32 |that are connected to gaelic and has highlighted and advanced the status of gaelic , the understanding| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24954 162:41 |of gaelic and the needs of its speakers .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24955 162:50 |users of bsl are similar to the gaelic community . as we heard , language is not just a means| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24956 163:05 |of conversation ; it is about identity and a rich culture . because of that , as a language ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24957 163:17 |bsl is just as precious as gaelic .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24958 163:22 |although there is existing legislation , and the question of equality is important , people| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24959 163:35 |in language communities have needs and aspirations and more should be done in that regard . this| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24960 163:43 |bill will give the community , the government and public bodies a policy that will be co-ordinated| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24961 163:56 |to develop the situation of users and to raise awareness of the culture throughout scotland ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24962 164:10 |in the interests of those who use the language .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24963 164:20 |carly brownlie : i agree that other pieces of legislation are already in place , but they| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24964 164:25 |mention things such as reasonable adjustments . how is a reasonable adjustment defined ? who| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24965 164:35 |i support the british sign language ( scotland ) bill , which will depend not on reasonable| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24966 164:45 |adjustments but on real achievements and outcomes . if we go to hospital , we are occasionally| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24967 165:01 |i feel that a bsl act would stop that and ensure that bsl is provided for people who| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24968 165:05 |want it through the use of an interpreter or in other ways .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24969 165:10 |clark denmark : i fully support what the other panel members have said . there is existing| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24970 165:19 |legislation on equality and disability discrimination , but from our point of view the legislation| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24971 165:25 |is piecemeal because there is not one clear statement of intent about how deaf people| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24972 165:33 |who use bsl can access services . that is the stumbling block , and we have already fallen| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24973 165:38 |over it .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24974 165:38 |the level of foreign language provision in this country far exceeds what we have for| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24975 165:51 |bsl , which is a british language . leaflets are translated for foreign language users| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24976 165:55 |throughout all the different authorities and service providers . we provide equality in| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24977 166:01 |that way , but equality is not provided for the deaf bsl community .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24978 166:06 |countries that were old british colonies , such as australia and new zealand , have the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24979 166:12 |recognition that we seek for bsl in their legislation . however , we do not have that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24980 166:16 |recognition back in the so-called mother country . our old colonies are more progressive and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24981 166:24 |pioneering than we are .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24982 166:25 |it has been a long journey , but it will have been worth it because we can see what is on| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24983 166:30 |the horizon . we can see the attitude of this committee and the parliament , and we want| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24984 166:35 |to see that enshrined in legislation . the hows , wherefores and whys can all be addressed| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24985 166:40 |in co-operation with the deaf community .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24986 166:43 |james dornan : it has been suggested that the bill could have unintended consequences that would have a detrimental effect on the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24987 167:02 |resources that are available to support people with other communication needs . does the panel| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24988 167:05 |have a view on that ? could other forms of communication be negatively affected by the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24989 167:15 |proposals in the bill ? if so , in what way ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24990 167:21 |professor turner : all the responses that the witnesses gave earlier indicated that they| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24991 167:29 |clearly understand and recognise that resources are limited and will always be so . the bill| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24992 167:36 |as it is framed does not demand that any particular level , quantity or sum of resources must become| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24993 167:57 |that the deaf community is saying that it is a willing partner and that it will work| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24994 168:04 |closely with the government , cosla and all the relevant authorities to manage expectations| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24995 168:15 |or anything disproportionate ; it is simply asking for it to be ensured that what is available| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24996 168:20 |is used effectively and in ways that the community believes will be of benefit .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24997 168:36 |clark denmark : the gaelic comparison is vital in this context . the scottish parliament has| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24998 168:43 |recognised that gaelic is part of the rich cultural heritage of this country , and we| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*24999 168:53 |quite rightly , a lot of resources have been given to gaelic in terms of television services| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25000 168:58 |and so on , so one could say that it is only fair that bsl is also given resources .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25001 169:03 |we do not expect to get everything tomorrow , because we understand that it is about a process .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25002 169:07 |as i said , the deaf community has waited for a long time and , from our point of view in| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25003 169:14 |scotland , extra resources will of course be required . however , let us think about the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25004 169:19 |issue positively , co-operatively and more strategically so that we have a true partnership| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25005 169:24 |between the deaf community , the government and service providers . the bill will not impose| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25006 169:36 |onerous financial responsibilities and it might just give clarity and focus in a centralised| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25007 169:41 |way so that the systems that are already in place are better co-ordinated and so that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25008 169:46 |the money and resources that we have are better spent and focused .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25009 169:49 |carly brownlie : i do not think that the bill will have a detrimental effect on other types| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25010 169:56 |of provision . i think that it will be positive for them because , as we raise awareness of| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25011 170:01 |deafness generally , that will have positive effects on other forms of deafness in terms| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25012 170:06 |of lip-reading , deafblind communication and so on . the bill will generally raise awareness| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25013 170:11 |and benefit other members of the deaf communities .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25014 170:15 |clark denmark : could i add something before you bring in professor dunbar ? the british| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25015 170:26 |government considered the issue of british sign language in 2003 and decided not to enshrine| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25016 170:32 |bsl in legislation at that time . it recognised bsl , which we were delighted about at the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25017 170:37 |time , but nothing has happened since then . there was a small pool of money and a very| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25018 170:45 |tokenistic recognition of bsl and there was a great deal of disappointment in the community| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25019 170:48 |stemming from that . we are sitting here 12 years later and , if we are talking about comparing| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25020 171:01 |of the uk since then . it has not been well done or well co-ordinated because there was| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25021 171:07 |no true involvement of the community and no real commitment .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25022 171:12 |you are probably aware of the spit the dummy campaign , which has been set up as a reaction| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25023 171:19 |to the fact that , a decade or so after the legislation , nothing has really happened .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25024 171:25 |the deaf community has been given little tokenistic sweeteners to pacify us and to shut us up ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25025 171:31 |in a sense . i would hate to see the pattern being replicated here of a small amount of| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25026 171:36 |money being given directly without having a big effect .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25027 171:40 |we have stated that we are willing to work with the government and with services to develop| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25028 171:45 |more cost-effective , centralised , smart and strategic ways of meeting our needs .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25029 171:51 |professor dunbar : i belong to canada , originally , where they are accustomed to bilingualism| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25030 172:03 |at a national level . many of the arguments used when parliaments bring in laws on additional| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25031 172:16 |languages are around extra costs and the effect of those costs on other services .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25032 172:34 |in the first place , but that is for historical reasons , as there were no services or training| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25033 172:46 |previously . however , with the passage of time , those costs are reduced .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25034 172:53 |also , when public bodies get accustomed to providing services in another language , it| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25035 173:02 |is much easier to do that with additional languages . for example , in toronto , where| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25036 173:08 |i was born , bilingualism at a national level had an effect on the development of additional| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25037 173:19 |languages . toronto is a multicultural city where many languages are spoken but more and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25038 173:27 |more services are available in other languages because people in public bodies do not look| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25039 173:36 |on multilingual services as being wrong or as causing problems .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25040 173:48 |as we develop our use of languages and become accustomed to those languages in scotland ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25041 173:55 |we are more likely to offer those services without doubling the costs as we anticipate| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25042 174:05 |for additional services for other language communities .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25043 174:11 |the convener : i will pick up on something that professor dunbar said . i represent the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25044 174:18 |parliament in brussels on the committee of the regions and i spend quite a lot of time| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25045 174:23 |in brussels using headphones and translation services . one of the big arguments in brussels| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25046 174:29 |every time i go there is about the vast cost of translation . at no point has that cost| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25047 174:34 |been reduced in any way whatsoever . in fact , one of the arguments in these times of austerity| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25048 174:39 |is about the amount of money from the budget that is spent on translation services and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25049 174:45 |interpretation . are you really saying that it would be realistic to keep costs of this| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25050 174:51 |minimal and that they would effectively reduce over time ? that is not what i see when i go| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25051 174:59 |to brussels .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25052 175:01 |professor dunbar : in brussels , the costs are associated with translation of european acts| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25053 175:12 |and translation services in many languages for european parliamentarians , people on the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25054 175:19 |commission and so on . that is a little different than providing services to the community ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25055 175:27 |such as education .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25056 175:31 |people talk about the additional costs of gaelic-medium education , but if we look at| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25057 175:40 |gaelic-medium education differently , we are not talking about spending extra money on| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25058 175:48 |gaelic . we are talking about spending on education ; it is just that that education is done through| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25059 175:52 |the medium of a different language .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25060 175:55 |that is true of many other services , such as health services . when somebody needs to| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25061 176:05 |receive a service through another language , they get the same service but it is delivered| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25062 176:10 |through the medium of another language .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25063 176:11 |there are costs associated with the training of people who have the right skills to deliver| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25064 176:17 |those services but there is not the same sort of multi cost as is the case with translation| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25065 176:37 |priorities in relation to british sign language .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25066 176:43 |professor turner : we have heard a lot in the evidence about concerns about the cost of| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25067 176:57 |interpreting . one of the beauties of the bill is that it encourages us to think about access| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25068 177:07 |to services , which might mean , for example , the use of interpreters , and promotion of| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25069 177:14 |the language .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25070 177:15 |on the promotion side , we can do an awful lot more than we have been doing , which will| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25071 177:20 |mean that the costs of interpreting do not have to escalate . the rationale for that is| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25072 177:25 |the one that the deaf community has consistently articulated , generation after generation .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25073 177:31 |rather than using interpreters , we wish to have services provided to us directly in bsl ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25074 177:38 |preferably by people who are members of the signing community themselves . if promotion| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25075 177:44 |begins with educating families in using sign language so that deaf children have the best| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25076 177:51 |possible start from the home with their families , those deaf children have the best chance of| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25077 177:56 |growing up to be highly competent , skilled professionals , like clark denmark , carly brownlie| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25078 178:02 |and avril hepner . the committee has heard and seen the quality of their evidence .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25079 178:07 |it is very clear that it is perfectly possible to imagine a deaf community that is making| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25080 178:13 |that kind of contribution to scottish society across the board . it starts with the promotion ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25081 178:19 |and the access issues will need to be maintained , but they will stay in their place .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25082 178:23 |the convener : thank you . i will bring siobhan mcmahon back in . i interrupted you , siobhan .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25083 178:31 |to leave . he asked the panel members whether the bill should include specific reference| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25084 178:36 |to the needs of deafblind bsl users . if so , in what way ? do you have an opinion on that ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25085 178:43 |clark denmark : it is obviously an important issue . i have many deafblind friends and colleagues .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25086 178:56 |between deafblind and blinddeaf . we talk about deafblind people as belonging to our community| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25087 179:01 |as deaf people who have lost their sight . blinddeaf people are those who , as the second| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25088 179:04 |panel said , grew up with english and then lost their hearing . those two groups are very| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25089 179:09 |distinct and have almost opposite needs .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25090 179:13 |somebody who grows up with perfectly good sight might lose their sight for a number| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25091 179:18 |of different health reasons . the most prevalent of those in our community is usher syndrome .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25092 179:23 |about 6 per cent of the deaf community has that retinitis pigmentosa plus deafness syndrome .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25093 179:29 |that is a substantial number . they already use sign language and then encounter difficulties| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25094 179:36 |later and need tactile , hands-on and other communication methods . it is essential that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25095 179:41 |the bill addresses them as equal participants in all of this .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25096 179:46 |carly brownlie : sasli also has a group of deafblind interpreters and we feel strongly| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25097 179:54 |that they are part of our community . people who can communicate using hands-on signing| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25098 180:00 |and the manual alphabet are an equal part of the community and we work in partnership .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25099 180:12 |siobhan mcmahon : finally , the second panel spoke about disability and the disabled , rather| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25100 180:18 |than seeing this as an issue to do with language and the cultural aspects that professor dunbar| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25101 180:24 |spoke about . do you think that the bill will go a long way towards establishing bsl as| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25102 180:30 |a language , rather than something that people see as a disability issue ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25103 180:34 |carly brownlie : yes , i believe that it will change attitudes of people generally , especially| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25104 180:43 |those who know very little about bsl in society . at the moment , people learning bsl are perhaps| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25105 180:50 |meeting a deaf person for the very first time . they are learning the language but they do| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25106 181:01 |more widespread and people learn the language earlier and at a younger age , it will influence| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25107 181:12 |or a disability tool . that is something very separate for us .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25108 181:27 |separate .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25109 181:27 |clark denmark : i want to add to what carly brownlie has just said . you heard earlier| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25110 181:34 |this morning that the deaf community does not accept the disability label and we see| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25111 181:38 |ourselves as a linguistic minority or community . this does not need to be an either/or situation .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25112 181:44 |we are not going to say that we are not disabled ; we understand that we can not hear and that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25113 181:50 |that creates barriers to how we access society . however , that is the secondary issue for us .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25114 181:56 |the bill recognises that we put our language , identity and culture first . we accept our| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25115 182:03 |disability in society , but it is important that what the bill does is put the language| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25116 182:10 |first , and that is right . that recognises our linguistic minority identity .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25117 182:16 |carly brownlie : that is why you have had a lot of submissions on facebook from deaf people ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25118 182:21 |who recognise that that is important for us .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25119 182:23 |the convener : i will have to ask members and panellists to be brief , if at all possible .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25120 182:29 |colin beattie : i would like to explore the effectiveness of the gaelic language ( scotland )| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25121 182:36 |act 2005 in promoting gaelic . are there any useful lessons learned that could be included| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25122 182:41 |in the bsl bill ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25123 182:47 |professor dunbar : there are lessons to be learned from the gaelic language ( scotland )| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25124 183:05 |act 2005 and putting it into effect . in many ways it is a little too early to be certain| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25125 183:11 |of the effect of the act . it came into force in 2006 and the first plans were made in 2007| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25126 183:24 |and 2008 , so the history of the act is relatively short . the effect that the plans and the act| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25127 183:35 |had on education about gaelic and education in gaelic is particularly relevant . that is| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25128 183:47 |very important in promoting the gaelic language and it is a similar situation for british| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25129 184:01 |sign language .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25130 184:02 |as we can see in the parliament , through signage and advertisements , gaelic is much more visible| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25131 184:13 |and , because of that , people know that the language exists and is spoken . there is better| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25132 184:23 |identity and acceptance in scotland that there is a multicultural community and a living| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25133 184:34 |community . those things are more important .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25134 184:39 |i do not think that enough emphasis was put on services through the medium of gaelic .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25135 184:49 |in my opinion there is a little too much emphasis on translation of annual reports and such| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25136 184:59 |things . without doubt , such things are important in raising the status of the language , but| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25137 185:06 |putting more emphasis on the services for people who use gaelic is very important and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25138 185:16 |that is what i would prioritise . the evidence that we have heard today and the written evidence| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25139 185:26 |show that that is very important .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25140 185:30 |the 2005 act has raised awareness and understanding in the community about our language and culture .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25141 185:57 |clark denmark : i am sure that you are all very familiar with the martin luther king| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25142 186:09 |have dreams .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25143 186:12 |professor dunbar was talking about services and what is going on in television and so| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25144 186:33 |has been going since 1981 and is one of the longest-running community programmes in the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25145 186:38 |world . where other programmes come and go , that flagship of the bbc has been widely recognised| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25146 186:45 |as an essential service .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25147 186:47 |however , we pay the same television licence fee as everyone else , and it is quite right| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25148 186:51 |that we expect perhaps not equity of service but something more than half an hour a week| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25149 186:55 |for only 20 weeks a year . such programming is vital , because it is the cultural expression| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25150 187:01 |of deaf people that allows us to identify with cultural institutions and artefacts that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25151 187:07 |celebrate our life , language and culture . it allows us , rather than being sad or depressed ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25152 187:10 |or hidden in the corner as disabled people , to celebrate and enjoy our deaf art , theatre| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25153 187:22 |again i congratulate the bbc , which in 1989 set up programming to allow people to learn| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25154 187:33 |sign language instead of having to take courses . we know that people in britain struggle to| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25155 187:39 |learn french and german , but the programme , with an accompanying book , was really popular .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25156 187:49 |we have such a beautiful , vibrant and exciting language to learn , and we could have seen| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25157 188:03 |to respond to that interest , and we did so by training british sign language tutors to| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25158 188:08 |meet the huge explosion in demand .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25159 188:11 |individuals have also made a difference . for example , princess diana was a great advocate| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25160 188:20 |and ambassador for british sign language as the patron of the british deaf association .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25161 188:23 |she raised the profile of our language because she could sign a little bit , and she provided| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25162 188:29 |such a great role model . that encouraged even more people to come to our community , and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25163 188:36 |promoted bsl in the most wonderful way .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25164 188:41 |we have talked about existing legislation , and adding to it , and discussed what is and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25165 188:48 |what is not working . the communications act 2003 contains a 100 per cent requirement for| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25166 188:56 |captioning , which is very important for the huge hearing-impaired and hard-of-hearing| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25167 189:01 |community whose first language is english .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25168 189:02 |however , people in the deaf community who do not access the world through english have| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25169 189:07 |struggled . we have invision interpreters to address the part of the 2003 act that gives| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25170 189:13 |us 5 per cent of all television programming across all channels . that works out at 94| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25171 189:29 |in the morning . they are not highly visible , and are not celebrating our language and putting| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25172 189:35 |it out there . unless you are a deaf insomniac , you will not be taking advantage of that programming .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25173 189:42 |education is the most important issue . i have a dream of a bsl channel , although that might| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25174 189:54 |my hearing counterparts , access what is going on in the world : home affairs and foreign| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25175 189:59 |affairs . i would like to get my access to the news directly through sign language before| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25176 190:08 |programming or educational programming . we could make available in a cost-effective way| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25177 190:14 |that suite of services , which would include leisure programmes and chat shows . of course| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25178 190:22 |we want that kind of equity , because we have those needs . the cultural life of deaf people| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25179 190:28 |is to be celebrated . what i have outlined is a dream , but it is a dream that is achievable| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25180 190:36 |over time .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25181 190:38 |the convener : we have to move on , because we have a lot of questions to get through| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25182 190:45 |in virtually no time at all .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25183 190:45 |gordon macdonald : i will ask about the content of bsl plans . my questions are similar to| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25184 190:50 |those that i asked the two previous panels . what should national and local authority plans| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25185 190:57 |include in order to be effective ? should the bill include some detail on the content of| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25186 191:02 |plans ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25187 191:03 |professor turner : i will answer your second question first . the way in which the bill| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25188 191:13 |is constructed is entirely appropriate , because we do not want to prejudge what the climate| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25189 191:20 |might be , what resources might be available and what the priorities might be for successive| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25190 191:25 |governments . the bill sets a framework and gives us an opportunity to address the priorities| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25191 191:33 |of the day , which is as it should be . there is not a strong lobby asking for more detail| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25192 191:40 |about plans to be included in the bill .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25193 191:43 |the key thing about the planning process is that it is participatory . i was delighted| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25194 191:59 |states clearly in paragraph 238 that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25195 192:08 |to them are taken . we want scotland to be an open and truly engaging country , where| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25196 192:19 |that is exactly what the deaf community is asking for . a planning process that affords| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25197 192:25 |the bsl-using community the opportunity to contribute and to engage in civic activism| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25198 192:32 |in exactly the way that the programme anticipates is precisely what the community is talking| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25199 192:42 |about .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25200 192:44 |this all puts some of the previous discussions in a very different light . as soon as we talk| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25201 192:50 |about comparisons between bsl and gaelic , we recognise that we are a long way away from| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25202 192:54 |asking questions about disability and resources around disability . for example , nobody says ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25203 193:09 |that gives us a clear idea of being in different territory altogether as soon as we view bsl| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25204 193:16 |users as a linguistic minority . it also encourages us to recognise that we are not talking about| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25205 193:29 |it because scotland wants it and scotland will be a better nation for it .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25206 193:36 |professor dunbar : i will say a word or two about the gaelic language ( scotland ) act 2005 .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25207 193:52 |it is somewhat similar to the bill ; there is not a lot in the 2005 act about the substance| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25208 194:00 |of plans . however , two things in the bill are very important and are even ahead of the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25209 194:09 |2005 act .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25210 194:10 |first , it is important that the bill says that public bodies should seek advice and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25211 194:21 |consult users of the language . it is good to seek such advice , but there should be longer-lasting| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25212 194:48 |and that link is very important , too .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25213 195:02 |and it has done that . since public bodies are not sure about what kind of plans to prepare ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25214 195:18 |national guidance on that would be useful for them after the bill is enacted .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25215 195:27 |those two principles are important . there should be advice and consultation , and a link| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25216 195:41 |between planning at national and local levels .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25217 195:47 |liam mcarthur : the witnesses will have heard the questions to the previous panels , so my| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25218 195:54 |questions will probably not come as a huge surprise . i will ask about having a minister| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25219 196:00 |with specific responsibility for bsl . you will be aware that the scottish government| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25220 196:06 |has expressed reservations about that and has said that it sees the issue more as one| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25221 196:10 |of collective responsibility , although it would sit within a portfolio and would therefore| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25222 196:15 |fall to a particular minister to drive forward . do you have any firm views either way ? if| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25223 196:29 |on the idea of a national advisory group that is made up of ministers , local authorities| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25224 196:37 |and other service providers as well as service users , the firm view in the bsl community| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25225 196:44 |is that service users should be the majority on that group . what are your views on the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25226 196:53 |desirability of such a group and its make-up ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25227 197:02 |carly brownlie : sasli agrees that we need to have an advisory group with a majority| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25228 197:08 |of bsl users . the regions of scotland are diverse . we have the north , the south and| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25229 197:16 |the central belt , which are very different . the north is much more rural and has different| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25230 197:21 |needs and services . the advisory group should include people from the regions who can express| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25231 197:27 |those different needs .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25232 197:30 |there should be a lead minister . we need someone who is accountable and who can take the work| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25233 197:36 |forward and cascade it to other ministers and departments . that minister should have| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25234 197:50 |should take the lead on bsl and cascade things to others . we do not want to be an afterthought| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25235 197:55 |for the minister . we want them to be proactive in ensuring that things happen as a result| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25236 198:01 |of the bill . the feedback from the advisory group is important in that process .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25237 198:08 |liam mcarthur : as the msp for orkney , i welcome that explicit expression of regional diversity .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25238 198:17 |on ministerial responsibility , one idea from the previous panel was to give responsibility| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25239 198:23 |to the minister who has responsibility for languages , including the gaelic language .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25240 198:28 |would bsl comfortably sit in that remit or does it need to be more explicitly drawn out ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25241 198:43 |diversity .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25242 198:44 |on whether there should be a single minister or a cross-department responsibility , i think| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25243 198:50 |that it has already been identified that , if there is not a single responsible minister| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25244 198:53 |but responsibility is shared across all departments , the levels of expertise , knowledge and background| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25245 198:57 |will vary wildly between those departments . one department might address the needs well ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25246 199:03 |while others might not .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25247 199:05 |we can see pitfalls and potential failures in that system . the best way of working is| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25248 199:10 |to have one department and minister with a clear remit that can be ultimately accountable ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25249 199:16 |supported by an advisory group with expertise .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25250 199:18 |professor turner : the conversations that have happened in the lead-up to the bill have been broadly clear that the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25251 199:36 |should be shared and that that is how it needs to be . equally , when it has been recognised| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25252 199:44 |that there is a particular linguistic minority , it would be slightly absurd if the minister| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25253 199:47 |who is responsible for languages did not have some role or position in championing the language .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25254 199:56 |if the bill is successful , there will be a lot of conversations to be had about the advisory| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25255 200:12 |future .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25256 200:21 |panel . their contribution to the panel would be a great deal broader than that of service| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25257 200:26 |users . if we think of deaf people as service users only , we are fixating on the access| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25258 200:32 |issues and losing the focus on promotion and on the contribution that the community can| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25259 200:38 |make to society in scotland .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25260 200:40 |liam mcarthur : i take my reprimand in the spirit in which it is intended .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25261 200:48 |the convener : professor dunbar , you are well aware of the process that was undertaken when| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25262 200:55 |we considered the gaelic language ( scotland ) bill and implemented it as an act . from your| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25263 201:00 |experience , will you give us some background knowledge on how plans were introduced , on| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25264 201:09 |whether the development of those plans was a particularly onerous process for the bodies| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25265 201:14 |that had to produce them and on ministerial responsibility and national advisory boards ,| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25266 201:24 |which we have just discussed ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25267 201:28 |professor dunbar : perhaps i should start with the ministerial responsibility for the language .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25268 201:57 |it is important that someone in the government has ministerial responsibility for that .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25269 202:09 |the gaelic community has been very fortunate with the ministers that it has had . alasdair| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25270 202:19 |allan is very familiar with the language and the issues concerning the wishes and needs| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25271 202:29 |of speakers of gaelic and other languages . what he has learned about policy and putting| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25272 202:38 |policy into effect for gaelic would be useful in relation to policy for other languages .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25273 202:48 |it has been important to gaelic to have a minister with specific responsibility for| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25274 203:01 |gaelic matters .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25275 203:16 |in addition to asking them to prepare plans , the board gives advice and support to public| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25276 203:25 |bodies , which is important . since there will not be a board or an equivalent body under| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25277 203:36 |the bill , the government should think about how it will consult and keep in touch with| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25278 203:48 |people on advice and guidance .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25279 204:06 |bodies expressed have been much reduced by the knowledge of the process that they now| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25280 204:13 |have as a consequence of the support that they get from the government and the board .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25281 204:21 |a system of advice and guidance to public bodies is important in reducing some of the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25282 204:30 |doubts that they might have and some of the difficulties that they might envisage with| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25283 204:37 |those responsibilities .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25284 204:47 |has suggested that the bsl national advisory group could undertake collective consultation| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25285 204:51 |on authority plans for a number of reasons , not least because the government is slightly| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25286 204:57 |concerned about the pressure on individuals and groups to provide advice and to review| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25287 205:07 |professor turner : are you asking us to respond to the suggestion of statements as opposed| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25288 205:14 |professor turner : as i have indicated , a spirit of consultation is abroad in the country as| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25289 205:30 |the country is very proud of that . it values the spirit of consultation and we are looking| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25290 205:37 |to develop that .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25291 205:39 |the key point to add is that we all enter the process looking for a long-term response| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25292 205:54 |to show that attempts to do so have been unsuccessful , one way or another . there is an incremental| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25293 206:01 |process of continuous improvement , and the community is keen to engage and participate| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25294 206:10 |in that process .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25295 206:11 |it is perhaps key to bear it in mind that the current position is contrary to some of| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25296 206:16 |the evidence that we have heard today . i invite committee members to review the evidence that| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25297 206:21 |has been submitted and ask whether they find many instances where deaf people describe| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25298 206:36 |services are out there . do deaf people tell members that the services are exemplary ? i| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25299 206:40 |do not think that they do that often . the community is looking for a process of continuous| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25300 206:47 |improvement ; it enters into that willingly and in a spirit of partnership .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25301 206:52 |the convener : what you say about exemplary services might be true , but my experience| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25302 206:57 |is that , across the board , not many people come to me as an msp to talk about exemplary| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25303 207:02 |services . it might not be the case that we hear about that end of the spectrum .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25304 207:12 |there be advantages in moving to a five or seven-year cycle for the national plan as| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25305 207:17 |opposed to the timeframe that is laid out in the bill ?| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25306 207:27 |professor dunbar : public bodies that are under an obligation to provide a gaelic language| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25307 207:36 |plan renew their plans every five years . that is reasonable . it takes a bit of time to devise| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25308 207:48 |a plan and put it into effect . it is important to allow public bodies sufficient time to| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25309 207:57 |do that , especially because language development is a complicated matter . it is not easy to| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25310 208:08 |put plans into effect quickly , especially when it comes to training and education .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25311 208:22 |at the same time , if the period allowed is too long , people are likely to leave things| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25312 208:36 |undone for some time . that is the danger in having a cycle that is too long . five years| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25313 208:48 |is a reasonable period . it gives bodies sufficient time to put their plans into effect and to| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25314 208:59 |review what they have done . the review is important because the bodies must know whether| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25315 209:04 |what they are doing under their plans is succeeding . some things might be successful ; other things| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25316 209:11 |might not be as successful . it is quite difficult to discover that if the period is too short .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25317 209:19 |it is a good idea to give bodies sufficient time before the next cycle starts .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25318 209:37 |we have been sidelined and marginalised for too long and have not been involved in the| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25319 209:43 |process for parliamentary and council issues and so on .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25320 209:48 |we need to give deaf people time to make the adjustment in their own mindset , which is| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25321 209:52 |a cultural or attitudinal change , so perhaps extending the time would be beneficial . perhaps| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25322 209:59 |there could be a phased approach rather than one that rushed things through , which could| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25323 210:06 |lead to the whole process breaking down . i recommend taking a more measured approach .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25324 210:15 |whether five or seven years would be an appropriate timeframe , although the gaelic experience| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25325 210:22 |is perhaps informative and instructive . five years is quite a long time , especially in| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25326 210:39 |expressed .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25327 210:40 |because there is existing legislation , we are not having to start from the ground up .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25328 210:55 |because our access to core services such as the police and the health service is sporadic| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25329 211:12 |in some areas , i imagine that changes in education would take much longer than changes in face-to-face| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25330 211:19 |social services at a local level , for example . the issue is what is workable , and the deaf| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25331 211:24 |community is prepared to work with you and to see the process not as a black and white| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25332 211:29 |issue but as a more complex one with a lot more grey in it that needs to be discussed .| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25333 211:39 |but it is now the afternoon . thank you very much for your time and your evidence . we will| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25334 211:50 |we will consider the bill next on 17 march , when we will take evidence from the scottish| nAsFZ0Vejzc
_*25335 211:58 |government and from the member in charge of the bill , mark griffin .| nAsFZ0Vejzc

_*25460 0:45 |when in washington dc , i visited gallaudet university .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25461 0:55 |this university focuses on educating the deaf and hard of hearing ,| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25462 1:00 |classes are given in american sign language , as well as some in english .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25463 1:11 |when in gallaudet , i met up with many deaf people .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25464 1:21 |my asl is pretty weak , but i used it to interview those here to learn about deaf culture| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25465 1:39 |they also shared the history of the university with me . here it is !| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25466 2:07 |so you work in the university ? can you tell us about the history --| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25467 2:32 |gallaudet was founded in 1864 . 100 before i was born , 1964 .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25468 2:39 |so abraham lincoln signed the charter that set up this school .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25469 2:50 |it started with a small group of deaf students .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25470 3:01 |i think many people live ( their lives ) in asl .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25471 3:09 |at the restaurant , people eat and sign together . gallaudet is like a deaf city !| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25472 3:25 |yes , we have a word for that . sometimes we call gallaudet the deaf mecca .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25473 3:30 |you know , where all the muslims go to pray ?| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25474 3:43 |how is deaf culture different here ?| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25475 4:00 |the policemen sign , the doctor signs , the teachers sign , everyone signs .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25476 4:24 |i saw in this o-f-f-i-c-e| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25477 4:31 |office .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25478 4:32 b-e-l-l UCotgGSjxEk
_*25479 4:36 |bell . yeah , with the light .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25480 4:54 |yes , the lights are part of our culture .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25481 5:11 |gallaudet is the only deaf university in the world . the only one .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25482 5:17 |rit , rochester institute of technology , in new york ,| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25483 5:21 |is a hearing school which has a subdivision called ntid , national technical institute for the deaf .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25484 5:38 |what about the students ?| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25485 5:42 |the hearing students ? undergraduate students need to know asl before they come .| UCotgGSjxEk

_*25487 6:02 |any time . nice to meet you . take care .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25488 6:06 |what is your name ?| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25489 6:15 ok UCotgGSjxEk
_*25490 6:17 |because our students come from different cultural backgrounds , they use different languages , different sign languages .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25491 6:25 |then they arrive here and learn a third language , which is asl .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25492 6:30 |and then they learn a fourth language , which is english . wow .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25493 6:36 |but our students are highly motivated . they work hard to succeed .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25494 6:46 |my name is julianna . sign name [ julianna ] . nice to meet you all .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25495 7:00 |american sign language is not the same sign language around the world| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25496 7:31 |since you are from ireland , right ?| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25497 7:55 |the community ? the irish sign language community is small ? not many people ?| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25498 8:19 |so this is another language to learn when in america . oh , i see .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25499 8:23 |i also like deaf culture . deaf people ask questions very d-i-r-e-c-t .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25500 9:00 |oh , did you know , in deaf culture , if you meet someone , say a friend ,| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25501 9:26 |right .| UCotgGSjxEk

_*25514 11:43 |you know what it means , awkward ? a person who is not very skilled socially or is clumsy .| UCotgGSjxEk
_*25515 13:02 |do people ask you about that ?| UCotgGSjxEk

_*26373 0:07 |when people see sign language for the first time , they assume that the sign language is universal .| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26374 0:22 |language . each of those languages has variation . i will give you an example to help you understand| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26375 0:30 |the meaning of variation . asl has variation of signs . the signs for early can be these : an open-8| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26376 0:38 |handshape moving backward or forward over a weak hand ; an open-8 handshape moving away from the nose ;| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26377 0:44 |or a 3-handshape moving away from the forehead . those signs are variants of early . another example is| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26378 0:49 |birthday that has many variants . we have this sign , born^day , that appears as two different variants ; the| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26379 0:56 |open-8 handshape moving from the chin to the cheek ; 4-handshape brushing down on the cheek ; and tugging| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26380 1:00 |on the ear . those are some variants of birthday . all of them are part of asl and they are accepted by the deaf| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26381 1:07 |community in u.s . so , they are viewed as part of variation .| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26382 1:12 |how variation comes about is based on two factors : social factor and geographical factor . the examples of social factors| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26383 1:27 |are : age , gender , race , and socio-economic that ranges from working class to upper class . those are social factors .| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26384 1:41 |a geographical factor is related to where people live . it also includes communities that are isolated from one another .| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26385 1:51 |there is something that separates the communities . for example , a river , a mountain , or a border that prevents| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26386 1:57 |the interaction between the two communities . social and geographical reasons are the likely factors to explain the| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26387 2:02 |lack of interaction between the communities .| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26388 2:06 |one aspect of asl variation i would like to discuss is black asl . whenever black deaf people get together ,| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26389 2:17 |their signing is noticeably different to other people . the signs are different . the expressions are different .| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26390 2:24 |the movements are different . there are outside comments about black deaf signing expressions . however , all of these| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26391 2:46 |the people who did the study on black asl were ceil lucas , carolyn mccaskill , joseph hill ( which is me ) ,| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26392 3:05 |and robert bayley . the first three of us were from gallaudet university and dr. bayley was from the university of| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26393 3:23 |that caused black asl to appear ? this question is related to social and geographical factors ; and 2 ) what are the linguistic| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26394 3:50 |movements , and signing space . the identification of these features can explain why one asl variant is different from| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26395 4:03 |other asl variants . that is the other question .| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26396 4:12 |for the black asl research , we focused on southern u.s. states as our research sites because there was the history| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26397 4:21 |of racial segregation in the south . schools for the deaf were also segregated with black and white children not being| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26398 4:36 |children . the six states that we did our study on were texas , louisiana , arkansas , alabama , north carolina ,| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26399 4:44 |and virginia . in each state , we recruited two groups of participants : people over the age of 55 in the older group and| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26400 4:54 |people under 35 in the younger group . the older group went to segregated schools for the deaf and the younger| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26401 5:11 |their own facial expressions and signs were still used by the younger group . it was necessary to have those two| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26402 5:19 |groups to answer our questions . when we had our older and younger groups in each states , we started analyzing| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26403 5:29 |the linguistic features of black asl as follows .| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26404 5:44 |instead of covering all features of black asl , i will discuss some of them . one feature i want to start off with is| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26405 5:52 |handedness , which means the number of hands in signs . for example , two 5-handshapes for deer or one| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26406 6:05 |one b-handshape . two handed signs are considered to be the standard signs , also more conservative .| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26407 6:11 |now the question is how two groups are different or similar : the black deaf signers and the white deaf signers ?| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26408 6:22 |black deaf signers tend to use two-handed signs more often than white deaf signers who use| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26409 6:28 |one-handed signs more . it seems that black deaf signers follow more standard signs with two hands .| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26410 6:42 |another feature is location of signs which can be made on the forehead or someplace lower . for example ,| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26411 6:49 |the sign teach on the forehead or in the lowered location ; the sign know on the forehead or lowered ;| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26412 6:54 |and the sign for on the side of forehead or lowered . the standard forms of the signs are normally made on| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26413 7:00 |the forehead . when we compared the signing data of black deaf groups and white deaf groups , we found that| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26414 7:10 |black deaf signers preferred to use the higher location than did the white deaf signers . it appeared that black| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26415 7:14 |deaf signers used the more standard form of the signs .| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26416 7:26 |the next feature to discuss is the size of signing space . the normal size of signing space is from the top of the| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26417 7:35 |head to the waist and from one shoulder to another . when we looked at the signing space used by black and| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26418 7:43 |white deaf signers , we noticed that black deaf signers used a larger space .| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26419 7:56 |we looked at the group of older black deaf signers and asked about their old signs . they showed us many| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26420 8:07 |different signs . for example in north carolina , the sign for science is an i-handshape jumping between the| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26421 8:14 |fingers of the other hand . the sign for boss is signed like cartoon with the c handshape . the sign for towel is| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26422 8:23 |signed like poor on the elbow . the sign for bathroom is signed like heart with the open-8 handshape on the| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26423 8:30 |chest . the signs in texas , for example , important is signed with the i-handshape that thumps down on the| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26424 8:38 |other hand and bounces back ; chicken is signed like diaper on the waist ; and bathroom is signed with| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26425 8:46 |the w-handshape brushing in front of the shoulder . in virginia , pregnant is signed like stuck with the| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26426 8:55 |v-handshape on the neck ; and birthday is signed with two 4-handshapes brushing downward on the cheeks .| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26427 9:02 |those signs are from virginia .| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26428 9:10 |we interviewed our young black participants with our thinking about the technology in their lives with social| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26429 9:17 |media , internet access , and captioning , any way they had access to words that contributed to their learning .| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26430 9:24 |also , they interacted with black hearing people and observed how words and phrases were used and how| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26431 9:31 |those were incorporated in black asl . when i asked them for the examples of particular words and phrases| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26432 10:17 |we , the research team , found a lot about black asl . we have rich data of it , but still it is not enough .| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26433 10:27 |there are many areas of black asl that are uncovered and we hope that someone out there will find more| y7ooYqdEdUY
_*26434 10:36 |things about black asl . this research is just the first step .| y7ooYqdEdUY

_*26761 0:05 |hello ! i 'm going to go ahead and explain briefly the history of asl .| bntj04WuBgA
_*26762 0:12 |today , we have the most complete , real , and expressive of any country| bntj04WuBgA
_*26763 0:21 |of the world and that 's asl . in fact , asl owes a lot of gratitude to the french . it was| bntj04WuBgA
_*26764 0:32 |the french sign language that was passed on to us in america and turned| bntj04WuBgA
_*26765 0:35 |into american sign language .| bntj04WuBgA
_*26766 0:38 |how was asl brought over here ? it came from a man named thomas gallaudet , a| bntj04WuBgA
_*26767 0:47 |minister himself , who became interested in helping the deaf after seeing a little girl| bntj04WuBgA
_*26768 0:53 |named alice cogswell . their encounter became a famous scuplture . here 's the| bntj04WuBgA
_*26769 1:01 |photo of it .| bntj04WuBgA
_*26770 1:08 |alice 's father , mason cogswell decided to encourage gallaudet to go ahead and| bntj04WuBgA
_*26771 1:16 |get involved with the process of starting a school for the deaf here in america .| bntj04WuBgA
_*26772 1:22 |gallaudet agreed and traveled to europe in 1815 , at the age of 27 , to study and discover| bntj04WuBgA
_*26773 1:30 |signed system for the deaf . he got to england and approached many different places and| bntj04WuBgA
_*26774 1:37 |asked how to teach sign language for the deaf . they all told him , `` no . ''| bntj04WuBgA
_*26775 1:43 |gallaudet was at a loss until he happened to meet a frenchman named ,| bntj04WuBgA
_*26776 1:49 |sicard , and he told gallaudet to come to paris . once there , he would show| bntj04WuBgA
_*26777 1:54 |gallaudet signing . gallaudet went to paris and was thrilled to see sign language ; then ,| bntj04WuBgA
_*26778 1:58 |he decided to persuade laurent clerc to come teach the deaf in america .| bntj04WuBgA
_*26779 2:06 |clerc consented and went ahead with the move to america . he became the first| bntj04WuBgA
_*26780 2:12 |deaf teacher and founded the first deaf school in hartford , connecticut . it was| bntj04WuBgA
_*26781 2:21 |called `` american asylum for the deaf . ''| bntj04WuBgA
_*26782 2:29 |since then , up until the 1960s , a man named william stokoe , himself a linguist ( misspelled ) ,| bntj04WuBgA
_*26783 2:45 |decided to research asl and then realized that it was n't like english . he , then , decided to| bntj04WuBgA
_*26784 2:54 |publish an article and it declared that asl is a true language . the linguistic community agreed ,| bntj04WuBgA
_*26785 3:03 |then in 1960s , asl was recognized as a true language , not a part of english .| bntj04WuBgA
_*26786 3:12 |and , today in 2011 , you 're learning asl online !| bntj04WuBgA

_*26800 1:48 |how old was he ?| XgCYVb7rlTw
_*26801 1:49 |about 25 .| XgCYVb7rlTw
_*26802 1:52 |when it comes to aids , the world is upside down : older people bury their kids ,| XgCYVb7rlTw
_*26803 1:56 |and kids are often better informed than their parents .| XgCYVb7rlTw
_*26804 1:59 |do you think they know everything that we learn about aids at school ? i doubt it !| XgCYVb7rlTw
_*26805 2:03 |therefore , kids must educate their parents !| XgCYVb7rlTw
_*26806 2:06 |imagine it : `` dad , mum ! open your notebooks ! take dictation . quickly ! ''| XgCYVb7rlTw
_*26807 2:29 |i just can not believe that you have n't had that talk with your kids yet about sex and aids !| XgCYVb7rlTw

_*26815 3:04 |oh , i do n't believe my ears !| XgCYVb7rlTw
_*26816 3:06 |that attitude leads to young girls becoming mothers ,| XgCYVb7rlTw
_*26817 3:11 |girls who do n't have the slightest idea how their own bodies function !| XgCYVb7rlTw
_*26818 3:15 |we were never told about those things by our mothers , you know .| XgCYVb7rlTw
_*26819 3:19 |that is just a lame excuse .| XgCYVb7rlTw
_*26820 3:21 |the real truth is simple , as you know well :| XgCYVb7rlTw
_*26821 3:25 |it concerns your children 's health , their lives , and you 're feeling nervous .| XgCYVb7rlTw

_*26831 4:54 |[ radio : ] you say that more than half of all africans living with the aids virus| XgCYVb7rlTw
_*26832 4:58 |were infected before the age of 25 . why is that ?| XgCYVb7rlTw
_*26833 5:01 |there are many factors .| XgCYVb7rlTw
_*26834 5:03 |one is that those who should provide young people with the necessary information just are n't doing so .| XgCYVb7rlTw
_*26835 5:07 |especially parents .| XgCYVb7rlTw
_*26836 5:08 |young people want their parents to talk to them about aids , but that 's very rare .| XgCYVb7rlTw

_*27390 3:44 |ask pay yeah| E7hCfSQX3Ew
_*27391 3:50 |are yeah ok i 'm back home| E7hCfSQX3Ew
_*27392 0:21 |recently , i took my dog to the vet , and after waiting , the doctor came in . the first thing he did was look at me and asked `` do you lipread ? ''| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27393 0:25 |i looked back at him and signed `` yes , do you understand sign language ? ''| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27394 0:33 |he looked at me with incomprehension , and then wrote| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27395 0:40 |`` do you lipread at all ? ''| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27396 0:46 |so i wrote back , `` do you understand sign at all ? ''| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27397 0:56 |he almost immediately got a look that said `` point taken ''| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27398 1:02 |and after that we wrote back and forth with no problem .| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27399 1:05 |why do i do that ? by looking at me and asking if i lipread ,| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27400 1:15 |he put a frame on me that i am handicapped , and that i need to lipread to accommodate him .| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27401 1:26 |i rejected that frame and put a different frame on myself --| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27402 1:37 |that we use two different , but equal languages . his language is spoken , mine is signed .| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27403 1:45 |nothing to do with not being able to hear or lipread or being handicapped or disabled or `` broken '' .| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27404 1:54 |the new frame is that i use a different language , and if he does n't understand me , it 's the same with me to him .| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27405 2:04 |easy way to make that point !| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27406 2:14 |same thing when i order at a fast food restaurant or enter a doctor 's office for an appointment or any situation where i need customer service --| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27407 2:24 |i approach these people and sign what i want .| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27408 2:30 |i always , or almost always get a response of `` i do n't understand what you 're saying . can we write ? '' and that 's always fine with me .| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27409 2:47 |sometimes , i get a nice surprise to find they learned sign in high school or college or their parents are deaf| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27410 2:57 |and we conduct our business much more easily .| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27411 3:00 |why do i do that ?| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27412 3:02 |suppose i were to approach them and verbally speak what i wanted .| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27413 3:12 |it would mean that they might overlook the fact that i 'm deaf , and therefore have no exposure to the fact that there are deaf people out there .| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27414 3:24 |also , it would again be a case of my accommodation to them , without their learning how to accommodate to me or other deaf people .| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27415 3:35 |suppose i were to instead approach them and gesture that i 'm deaf and ask if we can write ,| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27416 3:44 |the frame gets put on me that `` he 's handicapped , he ca n't talk '' , and they grudgingly get out paper and pencil to write .| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27417 3:53 |doing it this way allows them to maintain that `` handicapped '' framing .| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27418 4:02 |so instead , i approach them by signing , and often what happens is that| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27419 4:10 |i see their mental gears turning and thinking `` i do n't understand him ! '' not , `` he does n't understand me '' --| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27420 4:19 |`` i do n't understand him '' . they 're the ones with the problem ( not me ) .| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27421 4:26 |doing this , i give them exposure to deaf people ,| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27422 4:34 |plus , i make them think `` how can i work with this deaf person ? ''| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27423 4:43 |when they suggest we write , and it is simplified communication between us , they will remember this the next time they meet a deaf person .| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27424 4:54 |they will just whip out that paper and pen quickly .| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27425 4:59 |and again , i 'm helping to create a new reframing -- not one of being handicapped ,| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27426 5:09 |but one of linguistic difference -- they do n't understand my language ,| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27427 5:17 |so how can we work together on an even level ?| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27428 5:23 |through writing .| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27429 5:26 |frames are powerful things !| ENlmzMl4DM0
_*27430 0:00 |there 's a lot we do n't know about the food on our plates| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27431 0:03 |shops on the labels do n't always tell you the whole story| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27432 0:07 |package initially is very misleading| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27433 0:11 |can typically prussian get more what you get| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27434 0:15 |whether you 're staying in for going out| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27435 0:18 |you told us you can peel ripped off by the promises made for what you eat| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27436 0:22 |and what you pay for always say when i get to that selling the town of| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27437 0:27 |never can up i watch from claims that do n't stack up| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27438 0:32 |to the secrets behind the packaging me uncover the truth about britain 's food| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27439 0:37 |so that you can be sure that you are getting what to expect at the right| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27440 0:41 price sfIyabMGKHM
_*27441 0:41 |your food your money this| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27442 0:44 |israel africa| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27443 0:49 |hello and thanks for joining us right here in the very hot| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27444 0:52 |a republican office where today we 're going to get stuck into| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27445 0:55 |what i 'm pretty sure for a lot of us has to be one of the most important issues| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27446 1:00 |when it comes to of food| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27447 1:01 |and that is x aki is in it and| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27448 1:05 |how much can we actually rely on what it says on the label but you know you would| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27449 1:08 |hope that| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27450 1:09 |all the information you could aid would be crystal clear on the packaging| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27451 1:12 |but as you well know sometimes it is definitely not the case| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27452 1:15 |so we peel back the layers are some of the country 's biggest brands and| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27453 1:19 |best-known products| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27454 1:20 |have to tell you we have made some surprising discoveries| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27455 1:23 |about what actually inside including a few extra ingredients you might not| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27456 1:26 |expect it 'll| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27457 1:27 |but that 's just for starters because we 're also going to be exposing the way| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27458 1:31 |that some products actually do n't contain| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27459 1:33 |any a food that you would expect them to and we 'll be revealing how it is that| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27460 1:37 |companies can get away with selling something| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27461 1:40 |that may not big quite what you think| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27462 1:45 |coming up the labeling system that could help you make healthier choices| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27463 1:49 |so why have some about biggest food companies not signed up| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27464 1:53 |you have to read it the details on the back and you do n't have time to do it| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27465 1:58 |and they will use different systems which adds to the confusion its ok| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27466 2:01 |yeah it could be clear found heard the one about the beef product containing| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27467 2:06 |no beef you might be surprised by some of the ingredients missing from some| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27468 2:11 |other well-known products in your cupboards| sfIyabMGKHM

_*27546 6:50 |is what makes the being shiny the what you may not know is that was made from a| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27547 6:54 |substance that| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27548 6:55 |uses i did a buckskin all it 's not just the| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27549 6:59 |icky byproducts of the animal kingdom we can expect to find popping up in our| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27550 7:03 |food and drink| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27551 7:04 |there may sometimes be more familiar ingredients use the new| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27552 7:08 |in a thoroughly unexpected way creating combinations and fried stuff so we might| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27553 7:12 |never thought i 'd mixing ourselves| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27554 7:14 |for example milk in your wine anyone| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27555 7:18 |well it turns out that is exactly what you might find in many of the bottles we| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27556 7:23 |buy all the time| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27557 7:24 |not something that i 'd never heard of until i headed into the lab with our| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27558 7:28 |food science expect dock to be germane art| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27559 7:31 |so what happens in here then peter with the wind| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27560 7:35 |missus sandra she 's testing these wines for things that you might not expect to| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27561 7:39 |find in wine| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27562 7:40 |life from line apart from graves which you 'd expect to find in wine| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27563 7:45 |he would n't perhaps expect to find any milk in wind whistling| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27564 7:48 |oh yes seriously yeah amongst department in line| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27565 7:52 |well it 's the milk protein which helps to make the wine| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27566 7:55 |clear a if you added everything just| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27567 7:59 |calculates impose upon you can then filtered off you 're left with a nice| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27568 8:03 |clear wine| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27569 8:04 |which is what consumers want they do n't wan na hazy why calls| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27570 8:08 |line can also be clarified by using ache| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27571 8:11 |so as is a chance that traces can remain in the finished product| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27572 8:15 |that too is often listed in the ingredients| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27573 8:18 |cool what are some checking out pills| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27574 8:21 |she 's checking to see if there 's any built remaining in the wind| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27575 8:25 |the should n't they should all disappear during the processing| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27576 8:29 |but i 'm because mill is an allergen| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27577 8:32 |to some people the has to actually be declared on the label| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27578 8:35 |do is reach you when i have 107 times having a good look really| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27579 8:38 |hannah well hopefully there 's very little left| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27580 8:42 |and some reason is gone well she 's a| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27581 8:45 |testing these three wines and from the actual results| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27582 8:49 |we can see that none of them actually contain i| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27583 8:53 |detectable amount all milt you know it might say the labor guys| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27584 8:58 |it has been used in the process but is being| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27585 9:01 |lost during the process as well cool| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27586 9:05 |this may all seem like a bit of fun but there is a very serious side to finding| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27587 9:09 |unexpected things in your food| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27588 9:11 |allergic reactions which is why manufactures a pre-packed foods| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27589 9:16 |have to state on the label if their products contain one of 14 foods| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27590 9:20 |that can trigger allergies and why many of them choose to err on the side of| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27591 9:24 caution sfIyabMGKHM
_*27592 9:25 |and adam warning even a paladin 's may only possibly be fun| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27593 9:29 |it 's only in the last year or so this is actually had to be labeled| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27594 9:35 |as containing possibly containing militia| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27595 9:38 |the allergy fact checkers have the ala gym some people are much more legit than| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27596 9:42 others sfIyabMGKHM
_*27597 9:43 |so although we determined that this no| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27598 9:46 |milks left in here some people might react if there was a even one part per| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27599 9:51 million sfIyabMGKHM
_*27600 9:52 |in there other people who all of sensitive to| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27601 9:56 |male would not react to that low-level this very difficult to actually say| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27602 10:00 |there is so much here therefore it must be liable| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27603 10:04 |so in fact you have to say it too all bottles| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27604 10:07 |if it 's been treated with milt you must declare that process| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27605 10:11 |it 's the fact that even tiny tiny traces a particular foods| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27606 10:16 |can cause allergic reactions which makes it soo vital for us to know exactly what| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27607 10:21 |we 're consuming| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27608 10:22 |and so crucial that labeling is clear| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27609 10:25 |to prevent anyone eating or drinking a particular ingredient| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27610 10:28 |in a product they never dreamt would contain it later in the program we 'll be| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27611 10:33 |hearing just| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27612 10:34 |how serious finding something unexpected in your food can be| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27613 10:38 |gon na actually be| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27614 10:41 |it 's really struggling for breath and and| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27615 10:45 |feeling very dizzy and sometimes i would vomit| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27616 10:51 |if you 're trying to make sure that you 're eating healthfully and want to| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27617 10:54 |know exactly what 's in your food| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27618 10:56 |easy is it for you to find out by you might think but| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27619 10:59 |all you need to do is take a quick look an able but it 's really never been quite| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27620 11:03 |a straightforward is that because| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27621 11:05 |there 's never be a consistent approach by retailers and manufacturers| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27622 11:09 |about the way in which they present their information but in theory| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27623 11:13 |all that has changed because a new color-coded system| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27624 11:17 |labeling has now been introduced the idea being that| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27625 11:20 |pretty much at a glance you can now easily spot the nutritional content of| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27626 11:24 |the food| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27627 11:24 |you 're buying and just as importantly instantly| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27628 11:28 |understand what that means tony is| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27629 11:31 |some of the biggest names in the food business are refusing to play ball| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27630 11:35 |so what does that mean field if you 're keen to make the right choices| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27631 11:40 |with obesity in an all time high| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27632 11:44 |and the related health problems costing the nhs more than five| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27633 11:47 |billion pounds a year its no-brainer that most students will want to think| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27634 11:52 |about what effects the things that we put in our super market basket| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27635 11:56 |i can have on my health| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27636 12:01 |but to do that and to make informed choices| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27637 12:04 |we need hard facts about what his enough food| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27638 12:07 |which is where labels comes but doing our weekly supermarket sweep| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27639 12:13 |we do n't want to spend ages trying to figure out what they need| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27640 12:17 |isabel she gon is an expert in how consumers behave| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27641 12:21 |weekend she 's market let me do no shopping| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27642 12:24 |most diverse have got a very small amount of time| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27643 12:28 |some other costs more children with us so when making| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27644 12:31 |very quick decisions in fact it 's estimated that we typically spend| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27645 12:37 |under a second looking at the food packaging before deciding whether to pop| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27646 12:41 |it in the basket| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27647 12:41 |all pretty shell but up to now there 's been no uniform system for how| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27648 12:47 |nutritional information is displayed on food labels| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27649 12:50 |actually help us make up our minds so why does strolling down the supermarket| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27650 12:56 |aisles doing your shopping it means that you 've got to take in the whole load of| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27651 13:00 |facts and figures| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27652 13:01 |the presented n a variety of ways| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27653 13:04 |so french she may be trying to work out how many calories there are in something| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27654 13:09 |or whether or not the levels and sugar soul| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27655 13:13 |saturated fats are too high 8 really is quite difficult to make sense of it all| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27656 13:19 |fun picking up something looking at the front to the back and so on| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27657 13:22 |and where to find it it 's gon na take me longer and costlier not be| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27658 13:26 |look and mention so we need something that is clearly a| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27659 13:30 |and needed see it to find out just how easy it is to decipher the details on| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27660 13:36 |the packet| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27661 13:37 |we have taken to the streets armed with 3e pepperoni pizzas| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27662 13:41 |and the nutritional labels be found on the supermarket packaging| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27663 13:45 |each of them displayed their nutritional status| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27664 13:48 |in different ways this one displays the information| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27665 13:52 |on the front a pack it should use the percentage of your| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27666 13:56 |guideline daily intake of sugar facts actuate and sold| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27667 13:59 |and uses a color-coded traffic light system to show whether those amounts| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27668 14:03 |are healthy the next has the nutritional information listed| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27669 14:08 |under the ingredients on the backpack but does n't make clear whether the| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27670 14:12 |amounts of particularly high or low| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27671 14:15 |and the third one displays the percentage| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27672 14:18 |per serving a man adult 's guideline daily amount| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27673 14:21 |it does n't explicitly highlights and color or words| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27674 14:24 |whether the levels of sugar fat such a rich or salt ahh i| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27675 14:28 |sale which style labeled in shoppers find| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27676 14:31 |easiest to understand we asked them to stick one of our flags in the pizza| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27677 14:36 |which they thought at the clearest label fun| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27678 14:40 |thinking it| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27679 14:41 |traffic lights| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27680 14:45 |i think at the fair catwalk| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27681 14:48 |is easy to read possible| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27682 14:50 |thing happening on the back some really bad idea okay| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27683 14:54 |150 10 i believe| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27684 14:59 |successful place to have pizza this folder sees| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27685 15:03 |him at from a highly| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27686 15:06 |i 'm scientific experiment it seems it it 's the information on the traffic like| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27687 15:11 |style in neighboring| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27688 15:12 |that you find the easiest to digest but perhaps that should n't be a surprise| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27689 15:17 |its long bean method for which many in the industry have been pushing| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27690 15:21 |and that 's because it 's so simple to understand| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27691 15:24 |low levels and say salt or fat enabled green| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27692 15:28 |to suggest that the healthy while higher levels marked in red| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27693 15:32 |using the traffic light system we 've got and weekly a shortcut| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27694 15:38 |i know what green means i know what red means| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27695 15:41 |and if i see something like this is scott me know| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27696 15:45 |the majority red i 'm making an assessment fairly quickly| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27697 15:49 |i do n't have to no look all over the back on packet that various information| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27698 15:54 |i do n't necessarily have to work at well how much does this mean by 100 grams how| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27699 15:59 |much would a portion be| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27700 16:00 |and the government agrees| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27701 16:03 |and then 2012 introduced to design a consistent| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27702 16:07 |front a path labeling using the traffic light system| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27703 16:11 |is designed to make it easier for us to make healthy choices| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27704 16:14 |by highlighting when levels a particularly high the trouble is that| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27705 16:19 |some of the biggest names in| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27706 16:21 |food businesses simply refusing to use what is a voluntary scheme| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27707 16:25 |they will not a traffic light labelling on their part| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27708 16:29 |and that means that as a consumer you are going to continue to be faced with| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27709 16:34 |the role that bill well during| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27710 16:35 |choice a very hard to compare labels every time you go shopping| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27711 16:40 |amongst the companies who have n't yet signed up| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27712 16:44 |of coca-cola the biggest soft drinks company in the world| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27713 16:48 |can not times and birds i have also said known to the ski| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27714 16:51 |as has marlys international| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27715 16:54 |the snack food giant behind brands including cadres| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27716 16:58 |temblor en day really and philadelphia so why are the manufacturer says| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27717 17:02 |reluctant to use the traffic light labelling| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27718 17:05 |especially when you consider that this consumers we| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27719 17:09 |by millions have their products every single day| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27720 17:12 |when a recent survey showed that for sent to women in 30 percent| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27721 17:16 |men actually put off buying a product when they see the red traffic light| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27722 17:20 |because that indicates| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27723 17:21 |but it 's high in salt fact or sugar| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27724 17:25 |so could it be that manufacturers old really worried| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27725 17:28 |want to see what 's actually their products 15 them| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27726 17:35 |in fact while that may be true for some of them it 's not the whole story| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27727 17:39 |after all other big names whose products are likely to score read for some| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27728 17:44 ingredients sfIyabMGKHM
_*27729 17:45 |companies like pepsi mars and nestle have signed up| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27730 17:49 |and will display the traffic light labels so we ask the main companies| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27731 17:54 |resisting the scheme| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27732 17:55 |if we could interview them to find out why none of them| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27733 17:58 |wanted to appear on camera to discuss their opposition to traffic light| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27734 18:02 labelling sfIyabMGKHM
_*27735 18:04 |okay in fact instead some provided written responses which all said much| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27736 18:10 |the same thing| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27737 18:11 |that they keeping an open mind on the best labeling system| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27738 18:14 |for consumers they believe that the nutritional information may already have| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27739 18:19 |on their products| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27740 18:20 |is clear and transparent they also worry that the| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27741 18:24 |serving size used in the government scheme can be unfair| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27742 18:28 |for instance united biscuits say that they think it 's more useful to show the| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27743 18:32 |nutritional content| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27744 18:33 |her biscuit rather than per 100 grams| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27745 18:37 |as the government wants pointing out that 100 grams| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27746 18:40 |would be cool to touch esteves now you might wonder why it is that the british| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27747 18:45 |government does n't simply| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27748 18:46 |force food manufacturers to use the traffic light system| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27749 18:49 |it at metlife a lot simpler well the answer lies across the channel| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27750 18:53 |in brussels now food labeling is part in european law| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27751 18:57 |but so far the eu has not recognized| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27752 19:00 |the traffic light system and made it compulsory and that means| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27753 19:04 |but here in britain it has to be fallen tree| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27754 19:08 |and as a result with so many companies refusing to take part| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27755 19:12 |it 's thought that only around sixty percent to the food industry will be| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27756 19:15 |using be| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27757 19:16 |traffic mike labels the currently being rolled out| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27758 19:20 |but the department of health hopes that consumer pressure will persuade| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27759 19:23 |companies to join| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27760 19:25 |they told us that everybody including the food industry| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27761 19:29 |has a responsibility to help improve people 's diet and that confident that| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27762 19:34 consistent sfIyabMGKHM
_*27763 19:35 |from to pack labeling will give people the information they need| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27764 19:39 |to make healthier choices| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27765 19:41 |it does seem true that shoppers prefer this type the labeling| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27766 19:45 |which it 's hoped will make it easier to compare the food on supermarket shelves| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27767 19:49 |but with no way of making it mandatory and some in the industry| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27768 19:53 |adamant that the labels are not fair to their products| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27769 19:56 |do n't hold your breath for a scheme that covers everything| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27770 20:05 |as we 've been finding a throughout this series it 's not always easy to work out| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27771 20:09 |exactly what 's| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27772 20:10 |in the food we eat so unless you got something yourself| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27773 20:13 |your brother at the mercy of the food manufacturers not least because well| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27774 20:17 |sometimes the name of a product may make you think it contains a particular| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27775 20:21 ingredient sfIyabMGKHM
_*27776 20:22 |you might find in fact it does nothing of the kind| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27777 20:26 |stopping to forensically examine the packaging may not always be talk about| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27778 20:32 |shopping list when we 're losing run the supermarket with| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27779 20:35 |other things on our minds but sometimes what 's| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27780 20:40 |inside the packaging is n't quite what the name all the flavor on the outside| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27781 20:44 |might lead you to believe take a look at this| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27782 20:47 |ramen noodle soup for example chili beef flavor| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27783 20:51 |just a quick look does if you are making that instant decision in the shop| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27784 20:55 |so what would you expect these noodles to have in them world whatever else| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27785 20:59 |they 've got| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27786 21:00 |one thing is missing and that 's be i 'm what about this| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27787 21:04 |willy willy favorite popped promising a new| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27788 21:08 |freesia taste you might hope that peace to prison there| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27789 21:11 |and no it might taste fruity but| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27790 21:14 |inside you wo n't find any fruit at all the only way to know that| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27791 21:18 |would be to study the ingredient in detail but how many others| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27792 21:22 |always do that men were out shopping| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27793 21:25 |i 'm here birmingham 's wonderful bullring market| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27794 21:29 |where if you keep this up one thing it if you buy| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27795 21:32 |apple it contains apple| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27796 21:36 |and nothing else but processed foods are not so straightforward| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27797 21:41 |so how easily confirming and shoppers spot| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27798 21:44 |what 's what when it comes to prepared foods we fought three noodle products| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27799 21:50 |that probably have the word beef| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27800 21:52 |on the label only one actually contains any be for tool| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27801 21:56 |and even then it only has one point 8 percent beef in the whole thing| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27802 22:00 |so which is it way asking shoppers| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27803 22:03 |where 's the beef and as they try and guess we also find out what they 'd| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27804 22:08 |expect from these products from just that very first quick look at the label| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27805 22:12 |undiminished these 32 teams of three items that you will find| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27806 22:17 |if you do feel sick lucky shop bill michelle 's| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27807 22:20 |hyundai all got the word be home| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27808 22:23 |k lot only one actually contains any be| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27809 22:26 |be able have no be fertile so which of those three products to our shoppers| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27810 22:31 |think has the beef in| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27811 22:36 |but if they 're not finding the packaging instantly helpful| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27812 22:39 |one thing is clear confusion reigns| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27813 22:42 |all have not touched dunno pockets of some bundles| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27814 22:46 |because it 's not be same yielded| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27815 22:50 |you point maybe we 've all got the word feed estimate shop| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27816 22:56 |it 's got ssp funny should be| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27817 22:59 this sfIyabMGKHM
_*27818 23:00 |the largest market more legal point i 'll the time you know the most interesting| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27819 23:04 people sfIyabMGKHM
_*27820 23:05 |when you sleeping| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27821 23:07 literally sfIyabMGKHM
_*27822 23:10 |surely there 's one man on the market to should be able to tell the beef| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27823 23:13 |from the beach glass will butchers happen| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27824 23:17 |which one do you think the study great| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27825 23:24 |amigo pot noodle sad news is you owner and he picked| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27826 23:28 |to for have known people all night well i 'm| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27827 23:32 |i am the world hostile be is on their| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27828 23:36 |how do you feel about but but they will said they would be| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27829 23:40 |something about that and it turned out with anyone| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27830 23:44 |share presentation asian is states how many| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27831 23:48 |a hot people were sending me in spain| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27832 23:51 |and then put something it 's i 'm not money on get from stratified| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27833 23:54 |it might seem like basic common sense if it says beef| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27834 23:58 |on the package will find be in the packet but with plenty of our foods it 's| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27835 24:03 |not that simple| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27836 24:04 |so how can food manufacturers get away with suggesting an ingredient| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27837 24:08 |but is n't actually there it all boils down| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27838 24:12 |to the regulations and fun key long| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27839 24:15 |little world lot/land is labor and that word is the get out of jail free card| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27840 24:25 |for the food companies| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27841 24:26 |if something is labeled as flavored| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27842 24:30 |so beef label proved favorite section it does n't actually have to contain| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27843 24:34 |any the apparently key ingredient to tools so none of these products are made| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27844 24:39 |using even the tiniest bit at the foods| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27845 24:42 |name may make you think are inside but they 're not breaking any rules| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27846 24:48 |as long as it 's there somewhere that magic word flavor| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27847 24:51 |does n't need to be the same size as the name of the ingredients to make| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27848 24:55 |think you 're buying but armed ok so you better make sure you take your specs on| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27849 24:59 |the supermarket run| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27850 25:00 |but should be really have to look at the packaging quite so closely| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27851 25:04 |what the experts say : most manufactures would say| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27852 25:09 |you only go to turn the product over and you can see the exact| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27853 25:12 |ingredients that at that on the other hand from the consumer 's perspective we| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27854 25:17 |got ta remember that you know we do n't take| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27855 25:19 |lots of time checking everything out and we do make shortcuts| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27856 25:23 |if we see something that we can you know immediately recognize| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27857 25:27 |now like beef flavor we going to probably| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27858 25:30 |most the time assume that it 's got some beef in it| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27859 25:33 |pursue what would happen if the food companies made it easier for us| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27860 25:37 |by changing their labels to spell out not what is n't in their products but| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27861 25:40 instead sfIyabMGKHM
_*27862 25:41 |what they actually do contain their packets would certainly look| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27863 25:45 |rather different part reads ready to eat strawberry jelly| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27864 25:49 |slavery created in a no strawberry what so ever| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27865 25:54 |coloring derived from powder in say bodies| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27866 25:57 |and therefore not suitable for vegetarians| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27867 26:00 |band this uncle ben 's savory chicken rice| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27868 26:03 |you guessed it no chicken what so ever just chicken flavor| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27869 26:08 |show you meet three even a veggie talking| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27870 26:12 |spelling things out would certainly make things easier for time strapped shoppers| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27871 26:17 |but it probably would n't be as lucrative so i think it 's just this issue about| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27872 26:22 |responsibility from the point of view| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27873 26:24 |a manufacturers but i think you know how to manufacture here and most analysts| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27874 26:28 say sfIyabMGKHM
_*27875 26:28 |well you know that may just be too much information and it may put people off| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27876 26:32 |buying something what is| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27877 26:34 |you know perfectly good product| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27878 26:37 |when we contacted the manufactures a examples we 've shown they all said it| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27879 26:41 |certainly is n't their intention to mislead| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27880 26:44 |anyone with regard to the labeling and contents their products| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27881 26:47 |% uh the to noodle companies that did n't include beef| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27882 26:52 |reiterated that their packs have the word flavor| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27883 26:55 |clearly stated to avoid confusion and that they satisfy| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27884 26:58 |all labeling regulations they also point out that the packaging makes clear their| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27885 27:04 |beef flavor products| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27886 27:05 |are suitable for vegetarians whereas hark is todas| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27887 27:09 |there has to be jelly now has a new label % uh| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27888 27:13 |but there 's one further thing to keep in mind when you 're trying to figure out| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27889 27:18 |if they 're actually is prone annual prone cocktail crisps| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27890 27:21 |all beef in your beef noodles i 'm this time| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27891 27:24 |it comes down to to extra letters if the label says flavor did| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27892 27:30 |rather than simply flavor it must contain at ingredient| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27893 27:34 |it 's a lot to remember when you 're trying to make sense in the packaging| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27894 27:37 |quickly especially in the middle of the shop| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27895 27:39 |with the rules on labeling on likely to change anytime soon| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27896 27:43 |it seems there 's no way around it if in doubt ill| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27897 27:46 |just have to plow through the small print on the label| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27898 27:49 |as consumers we need to be aware that this is what manufacturers and| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27899 27:54 |advertisers doing| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27900 27:55 |and taking the potential assault| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27901 28:03 |the consequences are inaccurate and even fake information on food and drink| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27902 28:06 |labels sold in the uk| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27903 28:08 |can be very serious indeed when the authorities find examples that do n't| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27904 28:12 meet sfIyabMGKHM
_*27905 28:13 |british rooms they 're often sent here to the cantab oratory about food science| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27906 28:17 expert sfIyabMGKHM
_*27907 28:18 |doctor peter menard yet another mystery place you take into an authoritarian| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27908 28:23 |you 're not even really i 'll yeah there are certainly a lot of naughty samples| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27909 28:28 |in here yet| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27910 28:29 |so what is this an icy obviously not a different areas to who send you this| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27911 28:32 stuff sfIyabMGKHM
_*27912 28:33 |well a lot of different counties or environmental health| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27913 28:36 |my land and then what happens well we do the| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27914 28:40 |analysis that 's required and then we 'll look at the actual product| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27915 28:44 |and slightly i 'm will compare it with the legislation| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27916 28:48 |so for instance this one you can see is nice right| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27917 28:51 |soft-drink but it 's made in america made in the us i| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27918 28:55 |an incentive having i allura red| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27919 28:58 |in the listed ingredients it 's got red 40 well| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27920 29:01 |no one knows i 'll read forty years so not in this case the labeling is not| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27921 29:05 |correctly but i hear it 's not stand| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27922 29:07 |if it was made in europe he would not only have to say laura red| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27923 29:11 |but i would have to say that it might cause hyperactivity in children| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27924 29:15 |a that is not a requirement america its| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27925 29:19 |it no i 'm sometimes to that for this came from cambridgeshire| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27926 29:23 |the it means that you would send up back and say this ca n't be sold here| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27927 29:26 yes sfIyabMGKHM
_*27928 29:30 |what do you think i 've the labeling on that one| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27929 29:32 |i mean even unknowingly passed my classes i can see| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27930 29:36 |there 's not one word in english on it and suck| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27931 29:39 |what 's in it well i do n't know what 's in it of course and was this actually on| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27932 29:43 |sale oh yes| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27933 29:45 |said do n't like his heart for churning to fight anywhere that will not now be| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27934 29:48 |taken off the market| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27935 29:49 |i hope so yeah enjoying this a| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27936 29:53 |suffered this week that my hair is a a problem jim| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27937 29:57 |yes a and there is no english on me at all| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27938 30:00 |a so things like this should| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27939 30:03 |have on the back a uk duty stamp| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27940 30:07 |help because it does n't have a duty stamp it means it 's been imported| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27941 30:11 |illegally i 'm could you give up a countrified stuff coming in to be tested| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27942 30:14 |as well| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27943 30:15 |yes is anything to give the signal that this country fact there are sometimes| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27944 30:21 |a very subtle differences| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27945 30:24 |a sometimes the duty stamp is present| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27946 30:28 |but it does n't fluoresce and it should be a floor some stamp| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27947 30:31 |sometimes it 's slow the label is slightly off-center| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27948 30:34 |sometimes a it dates variable in very small| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27949 30:39 |otherwise but basically these days the labels| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27950 30:42 |counterfeit labels a very good but was the problem is that again you do n't know| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27951 30:46 |what 's in it| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27952 30:47 |said it not only some harmful harmful substances in it| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27953 30:50 |sir that 's notre yes yes in fact| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27954 30:54 |and we analyzed a song live chain a month or so ago| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27955 30:58 |which turned out to be mainly methanol from wood| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27956 31:01 |actually which is very poisonous indeed and which actually killed| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27957 31:05 |a young woman that rank it me| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27958 31:07 |so this is the kind of thing that we can find| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27959 31:11 |wrong with a it spurs particular so some other stuff in your daughter in asbury| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27960 31:15 |not indeed| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27961 31:16 |yes solve it can kill you there 's no doubt about it| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27962 31:24 |ended the program we had to endure is not surprisingly unhappy| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27963 31:27 |about the hidden ingredients in food industry uses| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27964 31:30 |but that could cause more than just a surprise| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27965 31:33 |sometimes the consequences or even tiny tiny quantities of unexpected things in| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27966 31:38 |your food| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27967 31:39 |can be very serious indeed busy mama| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27968 31:44 |twins justin build used to be a high-flying marketing executive i mill| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27969 31:49 |which involved its fair share| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27970 31:51 |wining and dining she had always been sensitive to watch ea 's| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27971 31:54 |but then the situation started to become more serious| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27972 31:58 |i have been having babies sa-two and i could n't praise| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27973 32:03 |they would start with pitching in mind now and throat it would sit progress| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27974 32:08 |sit down wit and| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27975 32:11 |then i would actually be sry struggling for breath and| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27976 32:15 |and feeling very dizzy and sometimes i would moment| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27977 32:20 |but west herbal was what happened when she got home one evening after thai| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27978 32:24 curry sfIyabMGKHM
_*27979 32:24 |and a few glasses of wine justin thought she was going into| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27980 32:28 |an anaphylactic shock i went to a pontoon and aidid| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27981 32:33 |and series test can protest from blood tests in| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27982 32:36 |results for civil negative to carry him having reactions| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27983 32:40 |say because it was hacked my breathing they| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27984 32:43 |quite worried about it they decided they would do such a talented with me which| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27985 32:46 |is where they took me into| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27986 32:48 |hostel for the day and they would feature with feet to me that| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27987 32:52 |been eaten around the time heavy action and it was on about| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27988 32:56 |search feature challenge that i react 2620 p.m .| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27989 33:00 |a dietitian| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27990 33:01 |and the doctor had looked at my feet are in love to all all| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27991 33:04 |to ingredients for jammin worked out that it was probably| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27992 33:08 |sulfite sulfites| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27993 33:11 |what 's occupied almost was still fights hardly register with most others but in| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27994 33:15 |fact we probably eat them everyday| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27995 33:17 |they used in the production and many foods in almost old one| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27996 33:21 |to prevent them going off so look at the labels for products including crisps| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27997 33:26 |marmalade jam cider and frozen prawns| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27998 33:31 |and ut additives such as sulfur dioxide which contain sulfites| sfIyabMGKHM
_*27999 33:36 |harmless enough for most but for those with an allergy| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28000 33:39 |the reaction can be pretty nasty| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28001 33:43 |it had a huge impact on my life because not only do i hate| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28002 33:46 |i might actually have a fatal attack| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28003 33:49 |because i was at times you not going to let you having| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28004 33:53 |is very low oxygen levels trailer pressure make| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28005 33:56 |going into such type shop clerks quite dangerous medically| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28006 34:00 |so trying to deal with that when you 're in your 20 is| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28007 34:04 |arm quite a.m. you know it 's quite a big thing to come to terms with it| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28008 34:10 |and then i used to get quite angry and resentful| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28009 34:13 |about the certain level law requires that produces a process| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28010 34:18 |foods have to label their products as containing sulphides| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28011 34:21 |the public can be that allergy sufferers like justin| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28012 34:25 |may react to levels a whatever they 're allergic to those who tiny| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28013 34:29 |they would be below the in mind that would even trigger the need to label| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28014 34:32 |i do remember actually going to a friend 's house for supper in| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28015 34:37 |cake this long left but i could n't 18 she 'd made two feet to accommodate me| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28016 34:42 |and she said she 'd made in each investor putting and| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28017 34:46 |i h from v2 national such a very ill and it turned out that she 's made her hit| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28018 34:51 |massive traffic| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28019 34:52 |cherries those had been preserved using the dreaded sulfites| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28020 34:56 |food is such a big big part of our lives at the food allergy| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28021 34:59 |was just making life miserable for justin the effective| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28022 35:03 |the allergy make me feel quite socially isolated and separated from my friends| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28023 35:08 |because i| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28024 35:09 |have to think twice about eating out or and| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28025 35:13 |socializing and said that have a pound check| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28026 35:17 |that is far from being alone campaign groups insist that there is a long-term| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28027 35:21 |rising trend a food allergies in the uk| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28028 35:24 |allergies are increasing enormously| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28029 35:27 |and have been doing for the last thirty forty years and the| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28030 35:32 |increase escalates with each decade| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28031 35:35 |and at the moment particularly| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28032 35:39 |food allergy in children is a very worrying because it 's really| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28033 35:44 |rising dramatically the biggest problems occur when| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28034 35:48 |unexpected things turn up in your food which can mean allergy sufferers have no| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28035 35:52 idea sfIyabMGKHM
_*28036 35:53 |at the aging and ingredients that can do serious harm to the child| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28037 35:57 |named doctor is a bonus kit pollard runs the food allergy clinic at the royal| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28038 36:01 |brompton hospital| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28039 36:02 |adjusting was treated she has seen just how extreme reactions to hidden| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28040 36:07 |foodstuffs can be legit as a whole spectrum of| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28041 36:10 |a free action some people just get it ching in their mouth which is sad| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28042 36:13 |a very common reaction adults right the way through| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28043 36:17 |really 22 people am having| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28044 36:21 |i 'm having to be hospitalized having breathing difficulties| sfIyabMGKHM

_*28047 36:32 |anaphylaxis can result in death said that that they can be very severe| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28048 36:37 |on the labeling pronto there is hope that the situation is said to get a| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28049 36:40 |whole lot clearer in the near future| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28050 36:43 |with an increase in the number of ingredients that manufactures must| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28051 36:46 highlight sfIyabMGKHM
_*28052 36:47 |on the label| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28053 36:49 |by december 2014| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28054 36:52 |regulation will come into affect| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28055 36:55 |that states that manufacturers have to include| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28056 36:59 |in the main listing : gradients any| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28057 37:02 |up to 14 named allergens in bold| sfIyabMGKHM
_*28058 37:06 |writing low that 's good news| sfIyabMGKHM

_*28168 0:45 |i was injured at 16 so i really was n't ,| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28169 0:49 |that was n't my first concern was whether or not i could have children .| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28170 0:55 |after i got home and really thought about it then on followup visits| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28171 1:00 |to my doctors i started asking questions and they were like , you know , you should be fine ,| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28172 1:03 |you know , as far as , you know , everything else works just fine , you know .| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28173 1:08 |i 've had 2 children and i delivered them both naturally , you know ,| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28174 1:13 |they were conceived the natural way .| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28175 1:15 |i did a home monitoring system , it was matria , and they did , it was a belt that i wore| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28176 1:23 |and it connected to the phone and since they , we were n't sure if i could feel the contractions| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28177 1:29 |or not the belt would monitor the contractions and the home office of matria is in georgia ,| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28178 1:36 |and there i was in south carolina| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28179 1:38 |when i was having braxton-hicks they would call and say , okay , it 's okay .| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28180 1:41 |do you feel anything ?| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28181 1:42 |i 'm like well yeah .| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28182 1:43 |it 's okay , it 's braxton-hicks .| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28183 1:45 |but when the time came it was like okay , you feel that ?| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28184 1:48 |i 'm like yeah .| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28185 1:48 |it 's time to go .| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28186 1:49 |so it was cool that i could feel it at the same time but i still needed that monitoring system| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28187 1:56 |to help me know the difference between you know , regular contractions and when it was time .| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28188 2:04 |well , when they were really small i used a bassinet and what we did was ,| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28189 2:09 |we just pushed it as close to the bed as possible and i was able to kind of just ,| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28190 2:14 |you know , lean over and , you know , it 's hard to verbally describe it .| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28191 2:20 |i would have to physically show you how i did it but it was a very interesting , you know ,| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28192 2:26 |the way i would kind of lean the baby to my body and actually they both kind| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28193 2:30 |of had a natural instinct to , to curl up to me so it made it easier .| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28194 2:36 |and as far as any other equipment that i used , i used a boppy .| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28195 2:41 |that helped with , you know , i did n't have to hold them when i was tired .| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28196 2:45 |they would kind of just rest into the boppy and when i breast fed for a short amount| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28197 2:52 |of time i used the boppy , you know , to hold them up for breastfeeding .| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28198 2:58 |so that was my major , i would say adaptive equipment .| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28199 3:03 |in dressing the baby i would just say using pretty much they were| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28200 3:09 |in onesies half the time and i thought it was very cool .| u_Pu2pCdAYo
_*28201 3:11 |i did n't have to adapt the onesies , they have onesies with velcro so i was able| u_Pu2pCdAYo

_*28599 0:01 |i have vivid memories at my deaf school . they had some kind of festival for the deaf children or asl| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28600 0:07 |literature week . students would get in the front of camera and sign stories . i always became excited| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28601 0:12 |whenever i signed in the camera . i received numerous awards which gave me the confidence to become a tv| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28602 0:18 |host today . i thank my deaf school dearly .| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28603 0:22 |everyone in my family is hearing and can sign , but my deaf school is where i always felt at home .| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28604 0:28 |reflecting my middle school days , i have always wanted to make movies . i borrowed a small camera from my friend .| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28605 0:37 |video camcorder and asked a dorm counselor for his permission to shoot on campus . he gave me his| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28606 0:41 |blessing as long as i could finish it in 2 to 3 days . i used my creative juices and shot lots of scenes .| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28607 0:48 |i tried my best at editing then everyone from the whole school came to watch my movie . it was the key| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28608 0:55 |to my inspiration . signing made it possible for me to communicate my vision .| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28609 1:06 |i was fine while attending a mainstreaming school all my life until i transferred to a deaf school .| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28610 1:10 |my confidence in creativity and social skills truly soared . i used to be timid and somewhat stoic when| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28611 1:16 |signing , but i now become more expressive and creative such as abc stories and sign play .| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28612 1:24 |when i attended a deaf school , i was assigned to read edgar allen poe in english class .| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28613 1:34 |i had difficulty understanding the raven , but i had a deaf teacher who was also fluent in asl .| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28614 1:40 |i understood the story completely and learned english with ease .| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28615 1:44 |while i was growing up , i always played sports league with hearing kids . however , they always made me feel| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28616 1:53 |inferior . that was until i entered a deaf school , i finally saw things in a different light . the coaches| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28617 2:06 |signed his plays and strategies directly with the players . with communication , there is a clear system .| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28618 2:14 |thanks to my deaf school .| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28619 2:17 |i always have been shy all my life , but theatre arts at my deaf school helped me build my confidence and| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28620 2:29 |overcome my stage fright .| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28621 2:32 |i attended a public school with lots of interpreters . once in a while , the interpreter would miss and there| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28622 2:36 |was no one else to interpret . so , i would have to take over and interpret for my deaf classmates . i transferred| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28623 2:40 |to a deaf school and the experience was so different . interpreters were not needed and i finally felt like a| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28624 2:43 |student without anyone else depending on me . i finally felt free .| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28625 2:47 |looking back , i met a person named , kim arrigo , a deaf teacher who introduced me to deaf culture and asl .| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28626 2:55 |her expressions were so powerful and i became more inspired to communicate more freely in my language .| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28627 3:07 |you watched all those stories , right ? i attended a deaf school , too .| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28628 3:12 |am i the last one ?| mkwYHheJQVw
_*28629 0:00 |hi everybody so today i 'm gon na be doing a video| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28630 0:04 |a little bit different than what i typically do . today i 'm| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28631 0:09 |gon na be talking about something related to my job and is related to my| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28632 0:13 |life and it 's very important . so what am i gon na be talking about ?| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28633 0:17 |vrs , you might be thinking what 's vrs ?| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28634 0:21 |vrs means video relay| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28635 0:25 |service and| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28636 0:29 |typically we just call it vrs . so you might think| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28637 0:34 |what 's video relay service , what vrs ? well if your'e deaf or if| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28638 0:38 |you 're hard of hearing , or maybe if you have friends or family that are deaf of hard of hearing , you probably| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28639 0:42 |already know what vrs is , but maybe you do n't know what it means .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28640 0:46 |so let me explain . vrs is something like , let 's say a deaf person| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28641 0:50 |wanted to use a phone . well how are they gon na do that ? a lot deaf people ca n't talk ,| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28642 0:54 |or obviously most of them ca n't hear well enough to use the phone .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28643 0:58 |so they use something like a camera , or possibly| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28644 1:02 |a vp , which vp means video phone .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28645 1:07 |it 's similar to a camera . so what they can do is have the camera rolling and the deaf person| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28646 1:11 |can use sign language . then someone like myself , who 's an interpreter ,| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28647 1:15 |will watch the deaf person use sign language and i 'll speak in english to a| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28648 1:19 |person who is on a regular hearing phone . then when the hearing person talks i 'll| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28649 1:23 |sign to the deaf person and vice versa . it 's a really cool process and it 's a lot| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28650 1:27 |easier for deaf and hearing people to communicate with each other . at least you 'd think so .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28651 1:32 |i mean it 's really cool . it 's a great idea , but| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28652 1:36 |now there 's a problem coming up . what could possibly happen in the future ?| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28653 1:40 |what it is , is the fcc , and fcc mean| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28654 1:44 |federal communication| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28655 1:52 |commission . so federal communication commission ,| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28656 1:57 |and we call it the fcc for short . what the| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28657 2:01 |fcc is trying to do is pass multiple parts of i think a law or something .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28658 2:05 |it 's gon na affect the vrs industry .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28659 2:09 |you might think oh well maybe they 're gon na pass something good . well no they 're not .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28660 2:13 |let me kinda explain what i mean . ok first of all ,| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28661 2:17 |the fcc thinks that things like video phones , you which have| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28662 2:22 |cool items like flashing lights you can see , or signmail ,| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28663 2:26 |so you can leave messages . they do n't think that that 's so cool .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28664 2:30 |they want to go ahead and save money and limit those features .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28665 2:34 |so the fcc would prefer that videophones ,| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28666 2:38 |ojos , or pretty much any other| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28667 2:42 |vp like equipment , they do n't want those anymore . they would prefer| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28668 2:46 |to go ahead and use regular off the shelf equipment , you know| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28669 2:51 |like a webcam , something you can put on your computer , or| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28670 2:55 |you know some laptops have some webcams inside . maybe some sort of| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28671 2:59 |webcam attached to your tv , or something like that , but things that are made for regular| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28672 3:03 |hearing people that you just buy in the store , like best buy , walmart , or target .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28673 3:07 |so that type of thing , computer and tv equipment .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28674 3:12 |that 's what the fcc wants . they do n't want videophones anymore .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28675 3:16 |they prefer to use just regular off the shelf equipment . you might think `` oh well that 's not| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28676 3:20 |a big deal ! you know i have an ipad , or i 've used my computer for making| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28677 3:24 |videos or something '' . but think about it , videophones have a lot of| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28678 3:28 |really nice features on them . for example like i told you before| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28679 3:32 |some videophones have a light , so when somebody calls ,| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28680 3:36 |the light flashes . so light regular people have a ring ,| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28681 3:40 |on their phone . a lof of deaf people ca n't hear that so they have a light that flashes . so| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28682 3:45 |they walk by they can say `` hey somebody 's calling me '' , and they can take the call .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28683 3:49 |well if you have something like a webcam or something like a webcam or something attached to your| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28684 3:53 |tv or just like in ipad . they do n't have someting like that .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28685 3:57 |so if someone tries to call you for whatever reason you 're gon na miss it .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28686 4:01 |so you could be missing really important calls . let 's say the doctor 's calling for test results ,| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28687 4:05 |or maybe a baby 's gon na be born soon in the family .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28688 4:10 |you want to know right away , so you can go to the hospital and visit them , or maybe| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28689 4:14 |you happen to have a family member that 's sick and is gon na pass away soon . you need to know things like| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28690 4:18 |that . but if you use regular equipment you 're gon na miss out| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28691 4:22 |on these calls , and that 's not anything that 's good . so| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28692 4:26 |you know if we use something like regular equipment it 's not customized| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28693 4:30 |for deaf and hard of hearing people , it 's just not ! so i mean| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28694 4:35 |obviously the quaility is gon na lacking there . also things like videophones| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28695 4:39 |and ojos and other types of equipment that are made specifically for deaf people| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28696 4:43 |are focusing on good quality picture . something like a webcam| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28697 4:47 |might not have such good quaility you know . if| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28698 4:51 |you want something with good quality it 's gon na be really expensive . you know like if get like| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28699 4:55 |a cheap webcam you might be like| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28700 4:59 |`` wait , uh what , what are you saying ? ? ? `` , because the picture is fuzzy and granulated .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28701 5:03 |ok , the second thing the fcc decided to do| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28702 5:07 |is you know now you get free videophones , you get free ojos ,| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28703 5:12 |you get free whatever . the fcc , they do n't want that !| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28704 5:16 |they prefer that you , the deaf or hard of hearing person , you buy your own| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28705 5:20 |equipment . so , let 's say mabye| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28706 5:24 |you 're on ssi , social security . you have a limited income . you might be| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28707 5:28 |only getting a few hundred dollars , and that 's it ! you know you got ta pay your rent ,| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28708 5:32 |your electricity . you have multiple bills you got ta pay and once you 're done| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28709 5:37 |you do n't have anything left ! now you| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28710 5:41 |do n't , you think `` oh great i have a free videophone i can talk with my friends and my family| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28711 5:45 |and do my business or whatever . '' if the fcc passes what they 're gon na pass ,| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28712 5:49 |you wo n't have that anymore . you 're gon na have to go and buy your own webcam . you 're gon na have to go and| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28713 5:53 |buy your own computer or tv or whatever ! it 's not gon na be free| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28714 5:57 |anymore . so , you might be thinking `` ok well now i 'm gon na have to figure out| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28715 6:02 |how to fit this into my budget , if i can afford it ? you know and if| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28716 6:06 |i can afford something is it gon na be good enough quality ? ! '' maybe you ca n't even| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28717 6:10 |afford anything . so you 're thinking `` how am i gon na call anyone ? '' well maybe you| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28718 6:14 |ca n't anymore . also you might not| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28719 6:18 |think about this but sorenson and other companies provide free routers| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28720 6:22 |for your equipment . you know i mean like sorenson , i think| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28721 6:26 |healinc , convo , all of those different companies , they give you| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28722 6:31 |free routers to have good quality picture . not anymore ! you 're gon na have to| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28723 6:35 |go buy your own router . let 's say oh well i want a good router ,| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28724 6:39 |one that has wi-fi internet . those can be pretty| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28725 6:43 |expensive and a lot of times people just ca n't afford it in this bad economy .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28726 6:47 |so pretty much what you 're gon na doing is saving up| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28727 6:51 |your money , go for months on months without any type of way to call anyone .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28728 6:55 |you ca n't get ahold of your friends or family . there 's really not much you can do| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28729 7:00 |about it . you 're gon na have to take care of yourself now . also ,| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28730 7:04 |now before i had mention about some of the features , you know| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28731 7:08 |with the videophones and what not . now if you have webcams and things| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28732 7:12 |it 's quite limited . so again like i talked about with the light , you 're not| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28733 7:16 |gon na have a flashing light anymore . now i know recently sorenson came out| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28734 7:20 |with something called and n-touch , which is good equipment to adapt to your tv or computer .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28735 7:25 |not gon na have that anymore . also| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28736 7:29 |like for exapmle sorenson has signmail . i know other companies have other ones .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28737 7:33 |so that way a person can leave a message for you if you 're| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28738 7:37 |deaf or hard of hearing . well might not have that anymore . so again| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28739 7:41 |let 's say you 're waiting for some realy important call and you 're not at| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28740 7:45 |home . well first of all you 're gon na miss the call , and second of all| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28741 7:49 |if someone wanted to leave you a message , well ... they ca n't ! so| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28742 7:54 |you 're gon na have to say `` oh well i had a missed number , who called me ? '' try and call back and they might not know .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28743 7:58 |it 's just really frustrating and it 's just very limiting and there 's not much you can| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28744 8:02 |do about it . now the last thing is really important .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28745 8:06 |you know if you 're deaf or hard of hearing person , oh you know this is n't gon na affect me .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28746 8:11 |it 's really no big deal ! maybe youre thinking oh i 'm a regular hearing person| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28747 8:15 |it 's not gon na affect me either . let me explain what i 'm talking about . again| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28748 8:19 |vrs pricing , now the fcc| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28749 8:23 |pays vrs companies per minute that people| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28750 8:27 |use our service . obviously when they pay| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28751 8:31 |you know each minute , that goes ahead and that pays for the interpreters . it pays for| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28752 8:35 |the equipment that the companies give out . it pays for the| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28753 8:40 |research for companies to come up with creative technologies to get better and better| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28754 8:44 |service . the fcc has decided , `` you know what| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28755 8:48 |i think we 're paying vrs companies too much '' , so they 're cutting them| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28756 8:52 |the prices . this is n't a good thing ! i mean| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28757 8:56 |obviously myself being an interpeter in the vrs industry| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28758 9:00 |you know this could affect me . you know if my company does n't| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28759 9:05 |get as much money from the government . meaning you know i| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28760 9:09 |might be be getting paid a lot less . i could even be| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28761 9:13 |fired ! you know and a lot people right now are going through that| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28762 9:17 |thing . you know they 're losing their job . they ca n't affod things and you know what that might affect me ,| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28763 9:21 |my family . maybe it might affect your family if you have an interpreter| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28764 9:25 |or you know if you are an interpreter yourself or| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28765 9:30 |just anything like that . it could affect them ! you know and it 's not| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28766 9:34 |only that i 'm focusing on `` oh me the poor interpeter , you know i 'm not gon na| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28767 9:38 |get paid as much ! `` , but it 's gon na affect you deaf and hard of hearing people as well .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28768 9:42 |so let 's say the companies are n't getting as much money from the government .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28769 9:46 |you know less , and less , and less , money over the years . that means that| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28770 9:50 |the quality of the service that your'e gon na get is gon na be lacking ! it 's just gon na| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28771 9:55 |get worse and worse and worse , because if the interpeters| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28772 9:59 |ca n't afford to work meaning your'e gon na have less interpreters available to do your| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28773 10:03 |service . if there 's not enough interpeters working| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28774 10:07 |let 's say you actually do get connected to vrs , you 're gon na have to| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28775 10:11 |wait ... ... and i mean wait !| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28776 10:15 |five mintues , maybe 10 mintues or even more . if you have an important| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28777 10:19 |call there 's really not much you can do about it . if the| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28778 10:24 |companies ca n't get the money and they ca n't do good research to give| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28779 10:28 |you better quaility products , let say you get connected to the vrs ,| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28780 10:32 |you could have a horrible picture ! you wo n't be able to see the interperters ,| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28781 10:36 |the interpreter ca n't see you and the whole experience is gon na be lousy . there 's nothing that , we| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28782 10:40 |the interpreters or companies , can do about it ! you know we are gon na| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28783 10:45 |have to adapt to that regular hearing person , off the shelf equipment .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28784 10:49 |which mean the quality could be lacking and that means| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28785 10:53 |that you as a deaf person are not gon na have equivalency as a regular| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28786 10:57 |hearing person would . so you know there 's many reasons that these new laws that the fcc| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28787 11:01 |are trying to pass are just not a good idea . it 's really important that you| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28788 11:05 |whether you 're deaf , hard of hearing , hearing , an interpter , whoever you are really| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28789 11:09 |doens't matter . it 's important that you give your opinoin . say what| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28790 11:14 |is on your mind ! tell the fcc , this is n't fair , this is awful ! i| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28791 11:18 |do n't like it . you know i feel like i 'm sub-class , i 'm not good enough !| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28792 11:22 |maybe the fcc people do n't even know anyone whose if deaf or hard of hearing .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28793 11:26 |they may have no idea , and they just do n't understand . you know they do n't| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28794 11:30 |understand what it 's like to be a deaf person and finally get new| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28795 11:34 |equality good equipment ! they do n't get it . so it 's really important that you| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28796 11:38 |voice your opinion ! tell them what you think !| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28797 11:42 |you know what i 'm gon na do is i 'm gon na go ahead and give you some links . i 'll put it here in the video| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28798 11:47 |and well as in the description box . i 'll put them both| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28799 11:51 |in those there so you can see both of them about some websites that you can go to . the| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28800 11:55 |first website that you need to go to was set-up just so that it 's a little bit| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28801 11:59 |easier for people to understand . it 's got brief explanations , just kinda like what| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28802 12:03 |i told you and it also has more video , in sign language , explaining| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28803 12:07 |again what the fcc is doing . that website| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28804 12:12 |is www.savemyvrs.com| 5x68QW9O68o

_*28808 12:32 |and in the links so you can see that below . now| 5x68QW9O68o

_*28811 12:45 |have to say and how you can help i 'll give you that .| 5x68QW9O68o
_*28812 12:49 |the fcc website , it 's called a public notice ,| 5x68QW9O68o

_*28946 4:39 |aids is a sex disease for immoral people .| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28947 4:42 |you can get it from prostitutes or if you sleep around a lot .| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28948 4:46 |aids is shameful , you see .| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28949 4:51 |him ! ? he ca n't keep his pants on !| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28950 4:58 |tested ? no , no , no , no , no , no .| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28951 5:01 |me neither . anything but that , because hiv positive equals aids equals death .| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28952 5:12 |they must be joking ! are n't ideas like that gone for good ?| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28953 5:17 |no , they 're comedians !| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28954 5:18 |or maybe this show was made two decades ago .| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28955 5:27 |no , i hate to say it but it 's a fact . on my last visit i heard some crazy things in dapura . you see ...| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28956 6:04 |what 's up , hey ?| nvVaW33P8Io

_*28965 6:30 |so , you can trust me , and you can trust your doctor .| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28966 6:42 |it 's like i said when i gave you your test results ,| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28967 6:47 |only you decide with whom you talk about it , and when .| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28968 6:51 |you see this cap ?| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28969 6:52 |yeah .| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28970 6:53 |it belonged to a friend i respect a lot .| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28971 6:56 |he wore it for the same reasons as you .| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28972 7:00 |but he was wrong too .| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28973 7:03 |his hiv positive status was never written on his forehead , like he thought .| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28974 7:10 |and , he gave it to me when he finally understood he would n't be needing it .| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28975 7:17 |do you mind ?| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28976 7:26 |there 's no mark ? are you sure ?| nvVaW33P8Io

_*28983 7:57 |i just wanted to scream in despair , and to cry every tear i had .| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28984 8:05 |i was afraid of everything . i was even afraid to look at myself in the mirror .| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28985 8:11 |i had a decision to make : either stay in a state of total distress , or fight .| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28986 8:18 |it was all up to me . so , i said to myself as i looked in the mirror :| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28987 8:29 |i discovered sources of strength and hope all around me .| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28988 8:34 |they live with hiv , and they are :| nvVaW33P8Io

_*28997 9:08 |i often see that the most dangerous enemy of an hiv positive person is himself .| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28998 9:26 |the first person who has to give you a chance is you .| nvVaW33P8Io
_*28999 9:33 |you know , it helps a lot to open up to those who love you and to have their support .| nvVaW33P8Io

_*29004 10:03 |told me he would be pleased to share his experiences with other people .| nvVaW33P8Io

_*30639 0:23 |i posted the original video this past sunday night , and by the next morning , the video had rapidly been spread .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30640 0:34 |however , a couple of people then contacted me with some concerns .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30641 0:38 |i immediately wanted to find out their thoughts , and they went on to share with me that there were some errors in the video .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30642 0:43 |my producer , summer crider loeffler , and i then regrouped , discussed the errors , and decided that it was best for us take down the video .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30643 0:53 |we did not like the idea of the video nearly becoming viral with errors , and subsequently removed the video .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30644 0:58 |afterwards , we gathered more feedback , did some self-reflection , and then identified the problems in the footage .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30645 1:04 |i admittedly did have some intuitive feelings that some of the content was rather sticky , but i still moved forward with publishing the footage .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30646 1:09 |for that , i take full responsibility , as well as full responsibility for the errors in the content .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30647 1:16 |in all , this was a really positive learning experience for me , and i appreciated learning from those who contacted me .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30648 1:28 |really : thank you .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30649 1:37 |but not to worry , i will go ahead and explain in-depth for those who are still asking what went wrong .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30650 1:45 |i have edited out the errors in the original footage and replaced it with new , updated footage .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30651 1:59 |that explains why the prior information was wrong , adding in correct information with explanations .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30652 2:07 |from there in out , the original footage resumes with some parts edited out as explained by the added footage .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30653 2:15 |i really want to thank you all for your patience and your support .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30654 2:20 |i know it was confusing and disorienting for the video to have been released and shared widely , only to be removed ;| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30655 2:25 |and that many people started developing all kinds of worst-case scenarios about what occurred .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30656 2:28 |summer and i both voluntarily decided ourselves to remove the video .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30657 2:33 |the two of us truly decided that we wanted to remove the video on our own ,| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30658 2:37 |feeling put off that we produced something with wrong information , and wanted to remove our work .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30659 2:41 |again , we voluntarily decided to do this .| C3Ae20lXJ1I

_*30675 4:07 |i specifically used examples from indigenous communities and other people of color groups , taking their resources and information about them to compare with the deaf community .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30676 4:22 |and many more horrible incidents . i have never experienced those , and i never will :| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30677 4:25 |and for me to go ahead and discuss those experiences , to make analogies with those experiences was wrong .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30678 4:30 |i have really learned to respect those experiences . while i can learn from and discuss those experiences ,| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30679 4:34 |i can not take those experiences and discuss them in comparative analogies . no- never .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30680 4:39 |i must respect those groups and their experiences . however , i can definitely discuss the deaf experience , of course !| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30681 4:45 |and what analogies can i use ? deaf and hearing people . for example :| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30682 5:00 |no , not at all . i can easily use this image as an example of a counternarrative because of how it challenges the master narrative of| C3Ae20lXJ1I

_*30703 7:17 |can not function beyond a specific level , and no amount of teaching will make a difference .| C3Ae20lXJ1I

_*30713 8:19 |deaf students would learn that they are cognitively limited and that they are retarded .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30714 8:22 |there are so many diagnoses and labels thrown at deaf people in this book .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30715 8:26 |that book is one example of a very powerful master narrative about the deaf community .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30716 8:32 |this book indoctrinated people in how they perceived deaf people and their beliefs about deaf people .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30717 8:40 |as teachers enter classrooms to teach deaf children , they are thinking , it 's worthless teaching them , but might as well try ... trying is better than not trying .| C3Ae20lXJ1I

_*30723 9:11 |the first category : `` recognize & resist '' [ image : green animation and text in the background ]| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30724 9:18 |first , we need to be able to recognize master narratives . if we are n't able to recognize master narratives , then how can we resist master narratives ?| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30725 9:31 |by recognizing master narratives , we are able to resist the damaging discourse and replace these with counternarratives .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30726 9:38 |by recognizing and resisting , we are challenging the master narrative - that 's the first category .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30727 9:44 |the first subcategory under `` recognize & resist '' is 1 ) resist outsider 's theories and labels [ image : green animation/background ] .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30728 9:49 |resist outsider 's attempts to label or define you . if they attempt to do so , resist by saying that is not how you would define or label yourself .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30729 9:57 |a classic example is `` hearing impaired '' . [ image : white ear symbol with a cross over it on blue background ]| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30730 10:05 |are you calling me hearing impaired ? well -- hey there -- time out . i 'm impaired ? i ca n't ? i 'm deficient ? i have a problem ? i have to be fixed ?| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30731 10:12 |whoa there -- time out . i 'm proud to be deaf . i am resisting their labels by not accepting how they define me .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30732 10:18 |i am educating them about how i want to be described . this resistance will multiply and help contribute to positive change .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30733 10:21 |that 's one example of resisting outsider 's theories and labels .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30734 10:23 |the second subcategory under `` recognize & resist '' is 2 ) recognize epistemologies [ image : green animation/background ] .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30735 10:27 |epistemologies refer to `` knowledge '' . western epistemologies do not really apply to us , hearing epistemologies makes more sense .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30736 10:37 |hearing epistemologies has been shared over many generations , and often has been forced upon us and our community .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30737 10:43 |we often have to remind them that we have a different way of life and experiences .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30738 10:47 |here 's one example : a deaf charter school was housed on a hearing school campus , using same buildings , facilities such as the gym and library .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30739 10:58 |there were scheduling agreements on facility usage . the hearing school had rules that the deaf school needed to follow .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30740 11:03 |one rule was when students transitioned from a building to another building , they would need to walk in a straight line , typical of a k-8th school .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30741 11:09 |since the deaf charter school was housed on the same campus , they needed to follow the same rule .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30742 11:13 |the agreement was mutual . as time went on , the teachers at the hearing school started having concerns about deaf students ' inability to stay in a straight line .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30743 11:20 |seems their behavior could n't be controlled ? were they having behavioral issues ?| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30744 11:25 |the hearing school decided to inform the deaf charter school about their concerns , specifically the deaf students ' inability to stay in a straight line , unlike their hearing counterparts who would stand impeccably in a straight line .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30745 11:36 |the deaf charter school employees took their concerns seriously and debated ideas on how to improve their students ' ability to walk in a straight line .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30746 11:41 |the discussions led to a profound paradigm shift . when standing in a line , where are the eyes ? standing in lines is a hearing construct , a part of hearing epistemology .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30747 11:49 |deaf people must have their eyes aligned with each other , where sighted space overlaps .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30748 11:54 |they studied deaf students walking in line , they were falling out of place because they had to shift their shoulders in order to communicate with the person behind or in front of them .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30749 12:00 |this was a profound breakthrough ! they came up with a solution rather than refuse to work with the hearing school . double lines was agreed upon .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30750 12:09 |the deaf students were able to make eye contact and chat on way to their next location without having to shift their shoulders !| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30751 12:14 |the double lines for deaf students were explained to the hearing school , along with a brief education about visual ( signing ) culture .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30752 12:20 |they were astounded and grateful about the lesson learned regarding hearing and deaf epistemologies .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30753 12:26 |the third subcategory under `` recognize & resist '' is 3 ) recognize ( academic ) gatekeeping techniques [ image : green background/animation ]| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30754 12:32 |not only academic gatekeeping -- there are gatekeeping techniques everywhere .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30755 12:38 |some gatekeeping techniques include allowing only good friends in , and not allowing strangers or people one may not be too fond of , perhaps because they look different , act differently , or talk differently .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30756 12:47 |admission is `` controlled '' . here 's one example . a publication was originally submitted to another journal , a deaf journal .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30757 12:55 |we submitted our article , and it was immediately rejected with major revisions .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30758 12:59 |we wanted to know why . this is an actual sentence from the editors of the journal :| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30759 13:02 |[ text : `` ... must the history of hearingness be repeatedly bashed over the reader 's head ? '' ]| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30760 13:08 |we were astounded and taken aback . we knew the importance of history in documenting pattern-based evidence and supporting the claims made in our article ,| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30761 13:17 |justifying the reasons for a specific set of research ethics to protect the asl/deaf community .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30762 13:21 |authors of academic pieces know the importance of setting up a trail of historical evidence leading up to their theoretical claims and constructs .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30763 13:27 |the editors who turned down our article felt that our emphasis on historical anecdotes of hearing researchers taking advantage of deaf people were excessive and completely unnecessary .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30764 13:36 |they wanted us to scale down the amount of examples and the tone of our writing . we were shocked -- however , we conceded .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30765 13:43 |we toned down the tone of the article according to their feedback and resubmitted . they rejected the submission again , asking us to tone the article down even more .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30766 13:48 |we toned it down so much that we felt the article was watered-down , and we were nauseated by the process . we resubmitted the article for the third time , and they rejected it again !| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30767 13:54 |we were fed up and decided to go with another deaf journal , submitting the original article we wrote , with all the historical anecdotes justifying our claims .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30768 14:05 |our original article was approved on our first try ! this experience hit us ... .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30769 14:11 |this is an example of academic gatekeeping !| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30770 14:13 |recognize those types of gatekeeping techniques and resist by moving to another one , and by not supporting the gatekeepers through a subscription or purchase .| C3Ae20lXJ1I

_*30775 14:44 |[ image : nad logo with nad in orange-red font inside a blue circle on a white background ] .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30776 14:47 |that section describing the author 's background tends - have you noticed ? - to include the author 's decibel level , for example , right ear 90 , left ear 110 .| C3Ae20lXJ1I

_*30778 15:02 |then the `` cause '' of the `` deafness '' would also be mentioned , for instance , meningitis , birth or gradual hearing loss .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30779 15:06 |this type of writing shows there is a different way of framing one 's background as deficient , problematic , broken or being proud of being deaf .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30780 15:11 |what would our author 's backgrounds be framed as if we were to challenge the master narrative ? certainly a shift towards a positive , cultural frame of our identity .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30781 15:19 |[ text/image : privileging knowledge and primacy of experience , in green animated background ] .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30782 15:25 |when you see academic publications , you tend to see parentheses and a name & year inserted in middle , for example , ( jones , 2005 ) .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30783 15:31 |authors are expected to cite publications in their writing , also called citing the `` literature '' .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30784 15:36 |citing , or in other words , mentioning other people and what they say , and then you say something , then make a point about two other people saying something| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30785 15:41 |that could be synthesized into one new theory , and so on . that 's pretty much how you write academically .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30786 15:47 |the academic english writing culture is deeply rooted in citing other people 's work .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30787 15:52 |now , let 's think about the deaf community , our culture , and asl ... are there plentiful of publications by us and with us ?| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30788 15:58 |how do we cite our own ? we 're trapped in this academic expectations cycle by having to cite mainly academic publications .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30789 16:04 |this is a quagmire where there are n't enough publications by our own people and we 're yet still expected to cite people 's work .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30790 16:08 |more importantly , we know so many deaf people in our community that are absolutely , incredibly experienced and brilliant .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30791 16:14 |our interviews with those brilliant and experienced deaf community experts should be equivalent to , or supersede academic publications .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30792 16:18 |set aside the academic cultural rule that we are to cite publications by privileged people , and honor those with direct and authentic experiences , and many different types of experiences .| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30793 16:28 |all that is related to `` primacy '' of literature ... or in this case , `` primacy '' of knowledge and experience , regardless of the number of publications or a terminal degree .| C3Ae20lXJ1I

_*30797 16:53 |perhaps at conferences or at different venues . why does the publication route have to always start with english first ?| C3Ae20lXJ1I
_*30798 17:01 |do you realize that means the first people who has access to this information are usually hearing , privileged people who are fluent and comfortable with academic english .| C3Ae20lXJ1I

_*30816 18:42 |there was very high turnover for deaf employees , due to different reasons such as low wages , lousy hours , and menial service work with very little or no compensation .| C3Ae20lXJ1I

_*31176 3:38 |now in in this area to be is there any place in this a new| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31177 3:42 |national coalition for the omagh certainly more than we some| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31178 3:46 |is the in cincy on the opposition group that has been representing the| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31179 3:51 |imposition for the last year they were simply| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31180 3:53 |incapable reaching out to our whites and when there has been| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31181 3:58 |small numbers in the sectors hmm| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31182 4:01 |the the old opposition group was was never able to open their arms in ca| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31183 4:06 |you know come on yes course will accept you and| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31184 4:09 |as you have gotten more radical elements| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31185 4:13 |with in the rebels in the north you have seen rhetoric| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31186 4:17 |on facebook pages and syrian state a lot of attention to| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31187 4:21 |to those pages i 'm you know talking trash about| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31188 4:25 |an our weights in syria and that has been a problem| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31189 4:28 |it remains to be seen if this new coalition can be morning| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31190 4:32 |includes is certainly which on that last 30| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31191 4:35 |has a reputation about being an inclusive| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31192 4:39 |man his his religious speeches have all been| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31193 4:42 |ins sectarianism he has spoken very critically| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31194 4:46 |against radicals in the rebels rings ruler| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31195 4:50 |and soon he is beginning that turn around but there is so much more work to| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31196 4:55 |be done| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31197 4:55 |to convince the alouettes that day are not| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31198 4:59 |in texas angeles lead with the syrian revolution| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31199 5:03 |yes and you 're quite right and ever and| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31200 5:07 |in saying that mother themes and you know statement said wall| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31201 5:11 |mean aimed at trying to bridge that gap rules remember them| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31202 5:15 |bringing in riyadh safe as a deputy bring into hannah cassie is deputy| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31203 5:19 |the these are people who are not known for being sick| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31204 5:22 |and also being you know hard-line when it comes to you| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31205 5:25 |and you know such issues and also having even| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31206 5:28 |in putting george number as head of the s & c there was a a very smart move on| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31207 5:33 |on the part of the muslim brotherhood essentially control that since each| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31208 5:36 |but really the question is on about whether these guys can create nasri| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31209 5:40 |narrative right now because| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31210 5:41 |its own post political representation really know can that narrative| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31211 5:45 |translated back onto the ground water that 's people who are you doing the| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31212 5:48 fighting q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31213 5:49 |and convince them that they need to be part in this press the need to adopt| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31214 5:53 |this new narrative| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31215 5:54 |this has been one of the greatest innings in my opinion of the opposition| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31216 5:57 |that they never really addressed| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31217 5:59 |the issue minorities the issue of the analytes the issue| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31218 6:02 |the you know the fears the christians and so on so forth| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31219 6:06 |and that was left basically hanging there and and and now this is going to| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31220 6:10 |come back to me| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31221 6:11 |in qantas there 's also the question of time is more and more time| q0kT57aT3Cw

_*31529 24:17 |someone is speaking they could simultaneously render| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31530 24:20 |their translation or they could work in conjunction| q0kT57aT3Cw
_*31531 24:24 |where a hearing person who can interpret| q0kT57aT3Cw

_*31579 1:05 |the conquest from habibullah 's ( sav ) tidings and the sultan accomplishing that tiding| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31580 1:13 |the conqueror of the conquerors , who closed an era and starting a new era| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31581 1:20 |the conqueror , fatih sultan mehmet han| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31582 1:26 |opening the era of renaissance , inventing the shahi canons , galloping his horse to sea , riding his ships on land| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31583 1:35 |and conquering the beautiful city of istanbul sealed his name as `` the conqueror '' in to history , are the first things comes to mind| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31584 1:40 |but not only those , his personality , his principles is setting examples for us today too| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31585 1:50 |his political genius made the world bound to empire , the importance he gave to justice , the free and respectful approach to science and art ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31586 2:07 |is bringing the need of reviewing him from every aspect in order to understand him| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31587 2:12 |as historians noted , he was born on the of march 29th| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31588 2:18 |his mother huma hatun was a very religious women , giving high regards to education .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31589 2:24 |his father was the 6th sultan of ottoman empire , sultan murad ii han .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31590 2:29 |he spent some of his childhood in the edirne palace .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31591 2:35 |then he stayed till he was around 10 , in bursa at a house which turned to a museum now .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31592 2:45 |later with famous hoca 's and scholars of the time , he was assigned to be the governor of city of manisa .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31593 2:53 |shahzade mehmet ii , like all the other shahzades followed the ottoman tradition of holding a government post| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31594 3:01 |as this practice turn to a tradition , the aim was to have shahzades gain experience in administrative and military fields ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31595 3:11 |so that they 'll develop their ability| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31596 3:15 |when shahzade mehmet ii was sent to manisa , responsibility of his education was given to molla gurani| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31597 3:25 |after giving this mission to molla gurani , sultan murat ii gave him a stick , if shahzade mehmet ever becomes lazy ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31598 3:37 |he told molla gurani to beat him up with this stick .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31599 3:40 |molla gurani leaves without saying anything , later on , to give lessons he enters shahzade mehmet 's room .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31600 3:47 |as he was holding the stick sultan murat gave , shahzade mehmet astonished , asks `` what are you going to do with this stick ? ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31601 3:55 |molla gurani answers religiously , i 'll remove the dusts of laziness from you ...| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31602 4:02 |this is your father 's order .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31603 4:06 |molla gurani , never used this stick and shahzade mehmet never had dusts of laziness as molla gurani calls it .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31604 4:17 |besides the lessons , he had to choose a profession as it was an ottoman tradition .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31605 4:23 |there were various reasons of this tradition of shahzades having a profession ...| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31606 4:32 |first of all it was the high respect for prophets .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31607 4:37 |because every prophet had a profession .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31608 4:42 |on the other hand the ahi organization that had great role in the foundation of ottoman empire ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31609 4:48 |all their sheikhs and murids had a profession and that had an affect on this tradition .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31610 4:54 |shahzade mehmet chose to become a cannon molder as if this was his first step to conquer istanbul .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31611 5:04 |prophet david 's tale in quran was an ifluence on shahzade mehmet 's choice of profession .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31612 5:13 |prophet david when he was the ruler of his country , he used to disguise and go around in public .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31613 5:19 |again , one day as he was disguised , he approaches to a person who does not know him and asks `` how do you know david ? ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31614 5:28 |the man says '' david is good '' says and adds , '' however , he has a flaw.he supports his family by receiving a salary from the government`s treasury `` the man says .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31615 5:38 |so , after that moment , prophet david ( as ) begs to allah ( st ) and asks him to grant him a trade .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31616 5:47 |allah ( st ) grant him the miracle of being able to melt the iron in his hands like a dough and give it any shape he wants .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31617 5:55 |after that day , prophet david ( as ) , supports his family by what he earns from forging .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31618 6:01 |in the light of all these , starting to learn the trade of forging cannon shahzada mehmed , would be appearing with a different side of himself , also will be mentioned as an inventor someday .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31619 6:15 |when he reach to 13 years of age , his father sultan murad 2nd wishes to leave the throne to him and to give himself to religion and to take a rest .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31620 6:24 |with that consideration , by making a 10 years duration treaty with hungarians , one of the swore enemies of ottomans| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31621 6:32 |he leaves the throne to his son mehmed 2nd on july 12th 1444 .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31622 6:37 |he then would retreat to manisa .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31623 6:38 |this date is the date of sultan mehmed 2nd`s first ascending throne .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31624 6:42 |first candarli halil pasha and some viziers opposed to a 13 years old boys ascending throne and becoming a sultan , yet , murad 2nd stood firm .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31625 6:53 |hungarians wanted to take advantage of ottomans having a 13 old on the throne , although there was a pact , they started their invasion .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31626 7:04 |they got together fast to prepare a crusade and enter to ottoman land .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31627 7:10 |while all these were going on , grand vizier halil pasa and other viziers convince young sultan to have his father murat ii be back in throne and head of army .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31628 7:23 |sultan mehmet ii in the letter he sent to his father , asks to have him come back to the throne.but he could n't get a positive respond .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31629 7:32 |after this with a second letter sultan mehmet make his statement firm and clear .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31630 7:40 |if you 're the sultan please come and lead your armies , if i 'm the sultan then obey my order and lead the armies .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31631 7:51 |murat ii comes back to throne and leads the armies , on november 9 , 1444 , wins the war called `` varna victory ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31632 8:00 |after this , murat ii stayed in the throne and his son mehmet ii assigned to become governor of manisa .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31633 8:07 |during his shahzadah era , mehmet ii gave priority to his education , besides arabic and farsi , he was learning greek and latin .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31634 8:23 |as he was learning horse riding and archery day time , he was on his knees learning the knowledge from his mentors night time .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31635 8:32 |since the day he heard molla husrev , explaining the hadith of prophet as , regarding conquering constatinople| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31636 8:39 |he was going trough deep thoughts , studying history books and doing research , making comments on why the city had been sieged so many times ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31637 8:46 |but never been conquered ...| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31638 8:51 |in one aspect it could have been said for him that ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31639 8:55 |to attain the tidings of prophet asv and conquer istanbul/constantinople was his youth dream .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31640 9:01 |one day he told this to his mentor :| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31641 9:04 |if i sit on the throne one day , i 'll try to make this tiding of prophet asv happen| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31642 9:09 |and you 'll guide me with your knowledge and enlight my way with your prayers .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31643 9:16 |shahzade mehmet ii also has a memory of this subject .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31644 9:20 |when he was a little kid , his father sultan murat ii , took him to go to haci bayram veli together .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31645 9:28 |sultan murat ii always had the taught of conquering istanbul in his mind .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31646 9:33 |when he shared his thoughts with haci bayram veli , haci bayram veli with smiling told :| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31647 9:41 |my sultan , istanbul will be conquered by this kid and by my beardless murid .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31648 9:46 |the kid he was referring to was sultan 's son mehmet ii , and the beardless was , his young murid ak semseddin .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31649 9:57 |after sultan murad ii 's passed away , shahzade mehmet ii comes back to the throne again .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31650 10:06 |young sultan had istanbul in his mind , to conquer the city ...| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31651 10:13 |but there are other problems to be solved ... karamanoglu ibrahim bey had an uprising and| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31652 10:19 |he was in the process of founding the state of karaman .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31653 10:23 |he was in agreement with venetians too ...| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31654 10:26 |sultan mehmet ii gathers his army and enters karaman lands .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31655 10:32 |as ibrahim bey becomes helpless without the support of venetians and other seigniory ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31656 10:37 |he asks forgiveness with his letter he sends ...| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31657 10:41 |young sultan mehmet ii thinks that it 's not to time exaggerate internal matters and forgives ibrahim bey .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31658 10:49 |in the meantime , byzantian delegates arrives to his encampment and requests to raise the annuity of shahzade orhan whom had given as hostage| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31659 10:59 |byzantine wanted to use shahzade orhan as a trump card and if the annuity is not raised , they were mentioning that ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31660 11:06 |shahzade orhan will be provided with soldiers and will be released| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31661 11:10 |byzantine , seeing that young sultan`s being busy with karamanoglu , as an opportunity to give him one more trouble and discourage him .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31662 11:19 |sultan mehmet thinking all of that , makes an evaluation , then says to delegates ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31663 11:25 |tell your emperor , we shall return to edirne soon.we shall think about his request .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31664 11:32 |hearing these words , delegates voice their displeasure but , sultan continues with a harsh voice .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31665 11:39 |it`s been told you to leave.know that , what our power may conquer , even your emperors`imagination may not reach .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31666 11:49 |delegates leave the encampment .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31667 11:52 |sultan mehmet , turns to the ones in the room and says , '' to silence this owl for eternity became our incumbent.make preparations , we are returning . ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31668 12:03 |thinking of conquering istanbul with a growing passion inside him , the young sultan starts to move , to execute the plans in his head one by one .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31669 12:13 |he comes in front of anatolia castle that was built by sultan bayazid at 1395 .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31670 12:21 |his idea is to buld another castle opposite of anatolian castle and cut the way of constantinople by the sea completely .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31671 12:32 |he turns to the ones next to him and says , my heavenly forefather sultan bayazid khan built this castle at such proper place .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31672 12:40 |so , we should built right across this castle another one .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31673 12:44 |with that construction starts to build rumelia castle .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31674 12:49 |the lumber was brought from izmit and black sea area , heavy duty stones and lime from different parts of anatolia .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31675 12:56 |construction of the castle continues at a dizzling speed .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31676 13:00 |during the construction of the castle , the architect of the castle muslihiddin aga , vizier sahabettin pasha and sultan mehmed`s teacher molla husrev were physically worked by carrying stones which gave the workers extra boost .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31677 13:15 |while the construction was continuing , byzantin emperor again was worried and felt disturbed from this situation and sent messengers to request for the construction to be halted .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31678 13:26 |sultan mehmed`s answer was harsh for this kind of a request .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31679 13:31 |`` how to use our land belongs to us.we don`t have intention of asking permission from anyone for that .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31680 13:38 |which power can hinder us.rumelia seashores belongs to us . ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31681 13:45 |after a day and night nonstop work , the construction of the rumelia castle was completed in such a short time as 5 months .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31682 13:52 |with that the black sea way was closed for the byzantine .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31683 13:56 |after the castle was finished , sultan mehmet goes back to edirne and starts to work on the preparations and speeding up the work there .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31684 14:04 |istanbul`s really strong castle walls were well known and it was not possible to knock them down with the cannons which were available that time .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31685 14:12 |knowing all these and realizing that he needs to built enormous size new cannons , sultan mehmet gave this job to a very good cannon molder master , called hungarian urban to mold the new cannons according to his plans .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31686 14:28 |on one hand , being busy with molding new cannons and testing them , on the other hand closely involving the training of the soldiers ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31687 14:36 |the sultan was thinking about possible problems that might happen with other neighboring countries and making plans not to deal with these matters while he is busy with conquering istanbul .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31688 14:46 |a peace treaty was signed with hungarians for 3 years , reneved the present peace treaty with the venetians .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31689 14:53 |he sent raiders , led by turhan bey and his sons to surpass the despots of mora , brothers of the byzantine emperors to mora peninsula .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31690 15:06 |watching all these preparations while paying great deal of importance to even the smallest details , padishah was working day and nights and especially| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31691 15:15 |while working at nights , he was taking care of his prayers and worship .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31692 15:20 |the time he was spending for sleep was hardly 2 hours .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31693 15:26 |his faith , his determination and his passion of the conquest wasn`t letting young sultan to sleep .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31694 15:31 |while ottomans were in full preparation , on the other side , fear and panic was dominating the byzantine .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31695 15:40 |byzantine emperor dragezes and the notables of byzantine were struggling to get some help from their neighbors .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31696 15:49 |emperor was ready to pay big compensates for the helps that would come .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31697 15:54 |besides , there was not seem to be another solution for them .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31698 15:58 |king of hungaria naibihunyat , has said that he could help in exchange of getting silivri and misivri and king of catalan asked for the island of limni for sending help .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31699 16:10 |accepting these requests right away , emperor dragezes , apply to pope nicolas too for help .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31700 16:17 |he promises to accept to uniting the catholic and the orthodox churches if a help comes from the pope .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31701 16:25 |receiving this offer , pope , sends cardinal of poland izolor with a full group of priests to istanbul .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31702 16:34 |both sects hold a ceremony together at st sophia.however , some of the priests in istanbul are against to the idea of joining two sects .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31703 16:45 |being the most important statesman second to emperor , grand duke notoras lining with those priest , shows his reaction in this matter by saying ;| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31704 16:55 |`` i`d rather to see turkish turban in istanbul , other than seeing catholic latin head dress . ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31705 17:04 |yet , emperor was ready to give in to anything to stop ottomans .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31706 17:08 |completely corrupted byzantine had one thing that was still strong , it`s castle walls .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31707 17:15 |always bragging for its strength , byzantine had one thing he could still be proud of , it`s walls .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31708 17:22 |finally , the time of start has come for the conquest .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31709 17:28 |when the ottoman army departed from edirne by sultan`s order , date was showing march 23th 1453 .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31710 17:36 |the people were spilled on the roads , praying for the sultan and his army and saying ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31711 17:40 |`` the commander that holly prophet ( asv ) was praising would be you inshallah ! ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31712 17:47 |on one side , religion scholars aksemseddin , mullah gurani , mullah husrev , fahreddin acemi , molla zeyrik and others| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31713 17:56 |on the other side , grand vizier candarli halil pasha , vizier zaganos pasha , saruca pasha other viziers , commanders and renowned by the world with its glory which will open a new era , ottoman soldiers .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31714 18:13 |after a 14 days of journey , the army arrives in front of istanbul on april 5th 1453 .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31715 18:20 |the giant cannons that have been pulled by 60 water buffalo and 400 soldiers are positioned in front of the castle .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31716 18:27 |on the 6th of april friday , a line of blockade was formed from ayvansaray to reaching to yedikule .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31717 18:33 |padishah`s tent , also called otag-i humayun was set up in front of topkapi and also , his teachers` tents were set up around his tent so , he could consult with them anytime he needs to .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31718 18:46 |the historians` accounts about the size of ottomans army`s , given numbers are different .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31719 18:54 |while some historians talk about 150 to 200 thousand soldiers , especially the number 300 thousands which was claimed by rumelian is remarkable .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31720 19:04 |for the conquest , on one side sultan mehmet and ottoman army has come to city`s doors ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31721 19:10 |on the other hand , byzantine has been taken some precautions to defend the city .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31722 19:17 |earlier , city walls were checked and repaired , cannons were installed in crenels , catapults were made that throw stone and flame ball .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31723 19:26 |furthermore , entrance of halic ( golden horn ) was closed using giant chains underneath the sea from one end to other end .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31724 19:31 |by doing that , the idea was obstructing of ottoman navy ships from entering that way .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31725 19:37 |right behind those thick chains , with 20 odd sized ships , an experienced navy commander and soldiers were positioned .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31726 19:45 |as an addition to all these preparations , deep trenches in front of the walls were filled with water and one years worth of food and water for the city was stored also .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31727 19:58 |with all that preparations done , emperor was telling that they were in safety now and no body could destroy the byzantine anymore and| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31728 20:08 |he was saying that , young ottoman padishah had an unrealistic desire and that desire was going to stick in his gizzard .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31729 20:17 |after the preparations were done , sultan mehmet sends his vizier mahmud pasha to emperor .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31730 20:24 |vizier mahmud pasha delivers these addressing the emperor ;| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31731 20:28 |my padishah , son of sultan murat , sultan mehmet khan demands you to surrender the city unconditionally .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31732 20:35 |if you surrender it , no one will be harmed .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31733 20:40 |you will be free to go anywhere you wish with your personage .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31734 20:45 |our religion orders us , to treat unresisting enemy with goodness .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31735 20:49 |however , the emperor gets angry hearing these words.he replies in a harsh mode .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31736 20:55 |my religion too , orders me to protect this holy city , considered as the heart of the christianity .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31737 21:01 |tell your master to go away ! don`t throw himself into the fire..| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31738 21:06 |vizier mahmud pasha , smiles to the answer of emperor and replies ;| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31739 21:11 |`` we are a nation which loves the fire . ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31740 21:17 |finally , with the arrival of the ottoman navy , the great sahi cannons started to rumble and first steps were taken for the conquest .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31741 21:27 |rums , watching from the hilltops , seeing the gigantic cannons` making loud noises and opening 2 lengths holes caused them being seized by horror and fear .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31742 21:41 |yet , the emperor and commander in chief justiniani were still thinking that , the ottoman army had to go back not being able to pass the walls .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31743 21:49 |the holes that were opened in the walls , were being repaired in the darkness of the night .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31744 21:58 |sultan mehmet , gives the order to take action to admiral baltaoglu sulaiman bey , therefor , he sends some of the navy ships to conquer the islands around istanbul and himself tries to cut the chains covering halic and attempts to enter into halic .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31745 22:17 |the battle was very hard and cutting the chain was not possible .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31746 22:22 |conquering istanbul , without entering golden horn ( halic ) was very difficult .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31747 22:26 |in the mean time , genoese ships , that pope had sent to help , carrying 400 armed head to toe genoese soldiers already entered to the waters of istanbul .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31748 22:38 |padishah , immediately gave order to baltaoglu sulaiman bey to stop the ships .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31749 22:45 |leaving with a few ships sulaiman bey , could`nt stand a change , against to the biggest war ships of that era , with his comparable small and low decked ships and| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31750 22:54 |had to retreat , after intense battles`with great losses .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31751 23:01 |watching all that`s happening from seashore and riding his horse into the sea with fury sultan mehmet , by yelling ;| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31752 23:08 |`` hey , how could you be defeated '' was showing his intolerance of this failure .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31753 23:15 |he would remove admiral sulaiman bey after this incident .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31754 23:22 |what needed was to pass the chains , surrounding halic and the navy ships behind those chains and to destroy that navy .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31755 23:30 |there must be a way to do that too .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31756 23:33 |there was a genoese colony on the galata side that time .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31757 23:38 |sultan mehmet had an agreement with those genoeses whose living in that colony , to leave them alone .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31758 23:44 |in return , the genoeses was not going to help byzantine .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31759 23:50 |although genoeses were two timing , sultan mehmet was not touching them .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31760 23:55 |during that war , one delegate from geneoses comes and comes before the padishah .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31761 24:02 |genoeses has a complaint to padishah .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31762 24:05 |he says that some of the cannon balls thrown at byzantine ships , fell down on their houses and they were devastated by that ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31763 24:10 |and for that reason , sultan needs to come up with a solution for that problem .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31764 24:16 |sultan mehmet khan replies to genoese by saying , '' allright , we shall find a way . ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31765 24:24 |thinking about heavily on this matter , padishah knew that all the cannons that was made until then , were hurling straight balls and these kind of incidents were happening because of this .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31766 24:36 |such a cannon should be built , so when the cannon ball was hurled , it should ascend in the air for a while , then while cambering should hit the target .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31767 24:46 |to put that idea into action , he immediately makes plans and drawings , then molds the cannon that was in his mind ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31768 24:51 |and by taking the helm of the cannon , himself shoots the cannon .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31769 24:56 |what he thought was happened.the ball first , took off by ascending , then landed by cambering .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31770 25:02 |during these test shootings , one of the enemy ships that was in halic was hit and sank .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31771 25:08 |so , a new leaf was turned over in the history about weapons , and what was called humbara then , it is written in the history as a weapon , invented by sultan mehmet himself , called today by the name of mortar .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31772 25:22 |for the sake of the conquest , the war was continuing at full speed , despite of the cannons pounding the walls , collapsed walls were being repaired at night wasn`t giving way and making the conquest more difficult .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31773 25:33 |looking for another way , the padishah knew the necessity of the navy`s being lowered into halic before , and was thinking that it was not possible to conquer istanbul without entering to halic .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31774 25:44 |while working at night , busy with making plans and thinking about the matter of how to bring the navy into halic ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31775 25:54 |padishah suddenly sprung to his feet and came out of his tent , with the idea just came to his mind .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31776 25:59 |since he can not pass through the sea , to enter halic because of the chains ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31777 26:04 |he was going to bring the navy over the land into halic .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31778 26:09 |immediately meeting with his viziers , padishah tells his idea to them .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31779 26:14 |hearing this idea , viziers could not hide their amazement , they said , it would be impossible to execute this idea .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31780 26:23 |while they were still thinking about the possibility of this idea , padishah , with a determined and harsh tone speaks ;| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31781 26:31 |we have come to fulfill a glad tiding from the holy prophet ( as ) . with the permission and help of allah ( cc ) , we make the impossible possible .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31782 26:40 |run ! find workers , find handymen ! from dolmabahce to beyoglu`s ridges open a wide road ! along the road side lay down slipways ! buy oil from geneoses and oil the slipways .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31783 26:53 |yet , keep this matter top secret , so byzantine would not realize what we are doing .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31784 26:58 |decision was made and for the people who are there , there was no option other than execute these orders .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31785 27:05 |according to the order that was given , the road is made and the slipways starts to being lay down .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31786 27:10 |after the phase of oiling the slipways , the carriages to put down under the ships and the water buffalos and the oxes to pull the ships would be prepared .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31787 27:19 |all these works would be done secretly and at a rattling rate .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31788 27:25 |seeing young padishah`s efforts and the passion for the conquest , his teachers now are sure of the conquest .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31789 27:32 |mullah gurani , with his murids comes to the presence of padishah .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31790 27:36 |beside his everyday dress , he has a shroud wrapped around his neck .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31791 27:41 |and turning toward sultan mehmet speaks ;| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31792 27:44 |my sultan ; the conquest is going to be given to you inshaallah.do not give up.i have come with my mureeds.our shrouds are around our necks.we took an oath on the way to conquest until we die .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31793 27:59 |moved by hearing these words , young padisah replies to his teacher ; thank you oh my teacher.we did not think of giving up even for one moment .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31794 28:09 |either we conquer istanbul or we die for this cause .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31795 28:13 |please pray for us .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31796 28:17 |and , the event of walking the ships over the land in one night , which would still be a dumbfounding event in the worlds` war history starts and ends up with success .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31797 28:28 |the ships now are in the waters of halic .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31798 28:36 |on the sunday morning of april 22nd , waking up to cannon firings of ottoman navy`s , byzantines were stupefied and looked like they were stuck between delusion and reality .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31799 28:50 |while byzantine were thinking how this could happen , genoese and venetien navies thinking they were in safety in halic , now the were caught between two fires .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31800 29:03 |while all these were happening , zaganos pasha who was ordered to make the soldiers to cross to the other side of halic , starts the work of building a bridge .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31801 29:12 |the bridge is made by , putting together more than one thousand barrells and on top of that making tie beams tied up together by chain ropes .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31802 29:20 |the bridge , by the way it`s built and by being the first bridge , built in istanbul is a first .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31803 29:28 |every passing minute working against him , the only way for the emperor is to sit with padishah and offer him a treaty .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31804 29:37 |with this intention , he sends his messengers to padishah on april 23th 1453 and presents this offer :| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31805 29:44 |if the siege is lifted , he was ready to pay the amount of tax determined by the padishah , he would give all the land up to the istanbul`s castle walls to ottomans ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31806 29:53 |also he would accept that choosing the officers whom responsible of the city`s security , would be given to padishah .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31807 30:02 |young sultan 's answer to this proposal will be clear and unequivocable .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31808 30:08 |he wo n't be giving up this passion and console with other relief .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31809 30:13 |he sent this message to the emperor :| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31810 30:17 |`` we 're son of sultan murat han , mehmet han , we 're chasing the tidings of our prophet . tell to your master ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31811 30:24 |to stop defending and surrender the city . if he does that we 'll give morea peninsula 's domination to him .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31812 30:32 |we 'll also give seigniory to his brothers , if he wo n't comply we 'll enter the city by force .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31813 30:38 |messengers brought this message to the emperor .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31814 30:44 |after thinking about it for a while , dragazes decides to defend the city till the last drop of their blood .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31815 30:50 |on may 26th , saturday he ordered to have st. mary 's big portrayal to be circulate at city 's public square and pray .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31816 30:59 |their last resort , as they believe , is to ask protection from st. mary 's holy portrayal .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31817 31:09 |whole city came together at the square , behind the priest and nuns carrying st. mary 's holy portrayal .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31818 31:16 |they carried the portrayal along the city walls , believing that protection will come from it .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31819 31:26 |around edirnekapi region , portrayal falls to the ground , facing down| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31820 31:35 |suddenly break of a storm , followed by thunders and lightnings , frightens everybody .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31821 31:44 |gathered crowd takes this as a bad sign and leaves .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31822 31:48 |evening of the same day , sultan mehmet , holds a meeting with his hoca 's , viziers and commanders in his marquee .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31823 31:56 |after an assessment , sultan told them :| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31824 32:02 |`` all of you made big sacrifices , but we want more from you . now you have to take this city . we want the good news from you not excuses . ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31825 32:13 |and finally , after midnight , with the order of attack , ottoman army 's calling `` allah allah '' drown out even the loud shahi canons .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31826 32:24 |attack towers were brought near the city walls , bizantiums were not able to close the holes opened by cannons .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31827 32:33 |mola gurani and ak semseddin were at the fire line advising and encouraging the soldiers .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31828 32:39 |21 years old sultan could not stand still , riding his grizzled horse , saying `` ya allah bismillah brave ones ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31829 32:48 |`` today is the day , day of gayret , keep going '' and he kept coming to the front lines .| Kv9qK8__RvE

_*31873 38:17 |his high ethics , diligence , most importantly his faith and mission to serve islam , explains clearly why and how he had these conquests| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31874 38:30 |when he conquered istanbul , all christian world thought that he will tyrannize these people ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31875 38:36 |as they were the tyrants , torturing the people they took over , it was normal for them to think like that .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31876 38:47 |it was the first thing they think of ...| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31877 38:50 |on the contrary fatih sultan mehmet , not only istanbul but at all places he conquered , to the people living there ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31878 38:55 |from different faith and nations , instead of oppression and tyranny , treated them justly so that they 'll live in comfort and peace ...| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31879 39:01 |right after taking istanbul , he asked roman orthodox church in istanbul , to choose their patriarch .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31880 39:08 |after the election of ginadios , the new patriarch , he send him presents .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31881 39:12 |he also protected the eastern christians , who were under he oppression of western christians .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31882 39:19 |the understanding of the justice at fatih sultan mehmet 's era can be explained by this impressive incident :| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31883 39:27 |sultan fatih , was building a mosque , the project was given to roman architect called , ispilante ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31884 39:33 |during the construction although fatih did n't want , ispilante cuts some of the marble pillars .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31885 39:41 |sultan fatih gets very angry when he heard this .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31886 39:44 |he cuts ispilante 's hand without consulting with anyone .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31887 39:49 |ispilante , brings the situation to qadi ( judge ) of istanbul , sari hizir celebi .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31888 39:56 |after reviewing the case , qadi hizir celebi calls for the sultan .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31889 40:00 |fatih sultan mehmet comes to court with this call , as he was about to take a seat , qadi hizir celebi stops him and says :| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31890 40:09 |`` you 'll be confronted with your accuser , stand up ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31891 40:12 |sultan stands up and confronts with ispilante .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31892 40:17 |ispilante was complaining , sultan is accepting that he cut his hand .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31893 40:23 |after listening witnesses qadi hizir celebi reads his verdict .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31894 40:28 |`` the one who cuts the hand of the architect , his hand will be cut too ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31895 40:32 |retaliation is in order . as sultan was listening the verdict in silence , ispilante was on his knees , crying and saying :| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31896 40:41 |`` i gave up on my case , with this kind of justice , i 'm becoming muslim too , do n't cut sultan 's hand ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31897 40:49 |with his request , they change court 's order . new order is for sultan to give a nice home to ispilante , he 'll take care of his family and pay everything .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31898 41:01 |case is resolved like this , everybody dismissed and there was only qadi and sultan left in court .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31899 41:08 |fatih sultan mehmet , by showing his sword to qadi hizir celebi , says :| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31900 41:13 |`` if you 'd be afraid of my kingship , favor me and make an unjust verdict , billahi i 'd cut your head off with this sword ! ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31901 41:24 |following his words , qadi hizir celebi , shows the mace he hide under his seat , says :| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31902 41:31 |`` my sultan , if you 'd ever be proud with your kingship and disrespect the court of sharia , do n't listen the verdict ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31903 41:38 |billahi , with this maze , i 'd crush your head ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31904 41:43 |fatih 's submission to the justice , as well as the judge 's obedience to the sharia , made to distinction between a sultan and a roman architect| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31905 41:53 |with it 's justice , high ethics and devotion to islam , this empire was raising on strong foundation .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31906 42:03 |regarding fatih sultan mehmet 's personality , his manners and high moral standing , all historians agrees .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31907 42:11 |with the advanced education and training , fatih knew greek , latin , italian , french , arabic and farsi languages .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31908 42:19 |he show importance and gave respect to the scholars , poets and artists .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31909 42:26 |he also wrote poems and used `` avni '' as pen name .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31910 42:32 |he studied sience , invented the first howitzer used for conquering istanbul , designed shahi cannons ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31911 42:41 |and he made history by making the ships sail on land to conquer istanbul .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31912 42:46 |he invited most valuable scholars to istanbul , supported their studies .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31913 42:52 |we brought the famous scholar ali kuscu from azerbaijan to istanbul , supported him for his researches .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31914 43:01 |sultan fatih became renown not with only his sword , but also with his respects to science , art and cultural improvements .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31915 43:07 |he took good manners and high ethic as his doctrine .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31916 43:12 |his aim was not only add more lands , expand the empire or an ambition to rule the world .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31917 43:20 |if that was the case , he would n't bring projects to raise the welfare level to those places he conquered ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31918 43:30 |he would n't achieve incomparable scientific or artistic works , mosques that would improve the social and cultural life ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31919 43:35 |madrasas , hospitals , bazaars and many others , none would have been done ...| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31920 43:40 |during his 30 years of ruling , he conquered total of 17 countries , brought them the beauty of islam and he very well deserved the name `` conquerer '' .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31921 43:53 |he did n't want to enjoy the kingship , left the worldly desires aside .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31922 44:00 |his mentor , molla gurani 's words always set an example for him :| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31923 44:08 |`` our religion forbids vanity and prodigality , all muslim leaders obeyed this order.khalifa hz . omer 's best meal was olive and bread .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31924 44:19 |because his people were eating olive and bread too . do n't forget this and live your life according to your people 's life . ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31925 44:27 |when he campaigned to conquer the empire of trebizond , army had difficulty to pass trough the scarped mountains of gumushane| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31926 44:35 |his endless determination , time to time made him to step down from his horse and led his soldiers to pass these dangerous mountain passes .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31927 44:47 |one of those times , mother of uzun hasan , sare hatun , approached to sultan and told him :| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31928 44:57 |`` ey son , this place called trabzon , does it worth all these efforts ? ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31929 45:03 |the answer fatih sultan gave , is an indication of his level of faith and his main purpose :| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31930 45:09 |`` ey mother , this hardship is for the sake of islam , we are holding the sword of islam , if we 'd not take this hardship , to call us veteran would be a lie ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31931 45:20 |his people had great love and respect for the sultan , they always kept him in their prayers| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31932 45:27 |one day , after returning a siege in anatolia , as he was passing trough the city of balikesir , his army took a break from the very hot weather .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31933 45:38 |sultan with his lips cracked with thirst , noticed an old village woman approaching him . she offers a cup of yogurt drink .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31934 45:48 |sultan noticed hay straws on top of the drink , he starts to blow to draw the straws away and drinks .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31935 45:57 |after finishing the drink he turns to the old woman and says : `` may allah be pleased with you , but these straws slowed me down to drink it in one sip ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31936 46:06 |old woman 's respond was beautiful :| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31937 46:10 |`` my son , i deliberately placed those straws there , you 're coming from a long road , sweating , i did n't want you to get sick by drinking the cold drink fast ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31938 46:20 |when time is 1481 spring , they were gathering for a new campaign , nobody knew where the war is going to be ...| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31939 46:31 |sultan fatih was keeping it very secret , he was n't explaining anything till last minute . `` even if a strand of my beard knows where we 're going , i 'll cut it off ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31940 46:43 |with the 300,000 soldiers of the tremendous ottoman army , on april 27 started to march from topkapi palace to uskudar ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31941 46:52 |and stays in the imperial marquee . but his sickness was getting worse , as his ancestor he had gout . he was trying to stand against the pains ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31942 47:06 |wanted to complete this siege as well . this time conquest was egypt . he was thinking that if he can complete this with victory he can die in peace ...| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31943 47:16 |but the disease was weaken him more and more ...| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31944 47:21 |for the treatment they called the surgeon general but it was not possible to treat it .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31945 47:26 |it spreaded to whole body and the pain in his joints was unbearable , but he did n't give up to continue the siege ...| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31946 47:36 |he ordered to march , altough karamani mehmet pasa adviced him to rest more , he did n't listen . they adviced to prepare a waggon| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31947 47:44 |he did n't want that either , preferred to ride the horse .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31948 47:51 |`` soldiers are used to see us on the horse , if they see in a wagon , there will be rumors , his urge of fight will get weak ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31949 47:59 |as they reached half way , his pains become unbearable , to ride his horse made him worse .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31950 48:08 |he could n't resist the pain and insistence , sultan had to ride on the wagon they prepared .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31951 48:15 |this was affecting sultan fatih deeply and his eyes were filling with tears .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31952 48:22 |at that night they came around the town of gebze and they camped there .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31953 48:27 |padishah become worse , he was suffering in pain , doctors gave him a pain killer called `` sarab-i fari '' .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31954 48:38 |as he hardly drank the medicine , he started to have difficulty in breathing .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31955 48:44 |he said , `` this medicine crumbled our lungs ''| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31956 48:48 |after a while he renews his shahada and he leaves this world , the grand padishah of the world , conquerer of the conquerers ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31957 48:59 |closed his eyes to this world on may 3 1481 and took his first step to eternal life ...| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31958 49:07 |the values he left behind , will have him always be remembered with rahmat and respect .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31959 49:14 |if sultan fatih was a bloodthirsty , tyrannizing ruler like europe claims ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31960 49:19 |he would torture the byzantiums as the rotten medieval christians tortured the muslims frightfully ...| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31961 49:27 |but fatih never did that , he never chose slaughtering the kings and their people of the lands he conquered .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31962 49:41 |historical facts made even the worst ones to tell the truth , who slandered him with unbelievable lies , how fatih sultan was gracious ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31963 49:53 |when he entered istanbul how merciful he was to the scared people of the city .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31964 49:58 |one of front fortresses of the western world , istanbul , when conquered , as western civilization and islam civilization met ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31965 50:06 |western civilization was failed .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31966 50:09 |with fatih as it was rebuilt , istanbul become the center of islam civilization for hundreds of years , it also become the center of whole civilization .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31967 50:21 |fatih sultan mehmet 's success , his victories , the conquest that changed the world , of course can not be credited as one person 's achievement .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31968 50:31 |but his faith , his devotion , his ruling of his army and his people , his respect for his hoca 's and the scholars ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31969 50:39 |in short , the values he has in his personality , made him that important , that he is a turning point in history .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31970 50:48 |as we remember him one more time , not only by remembering his big conquest and his military genius ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31971 50:56 |but also to see what made him this important , we 're impressing the necessity of seeing the values of his personality ,| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31972 51:02 |that made him fatih and taking the real lessons out of it .| Kv9qK8__RvE
_*31973 51:06 |we commemorate him with rahmet and respect ...| Kv9qK8__RvE

_*32065 3:56 |there must be light there . it seems a bit over exaggerated to have it everywhere , but we are equal to the hearing .| a9d-uW4STnk
_*32066 4:07 |not lower down , but at the same level of the hearing . everyone should get the same information .| a9d-uW4STnk
_*32067 4:20 |you see that the lights are off in the store , it 's the fire alarm that just started , said sarah .| a9d-uW4STnk
_*32068 4:27 |but the lights and the sounds ? i get no information .| a9d-uW4STnk
_*32069 4:33 |for example : i travel by tram and the speaker is saying something . it should be texted too .| a9d-uW4STnk
_*32070 4:44 |both swedish and english so that the tourists can keep up . not only in swedish so the tourists miss everything .| a9d-uW4STnk
_*32071 4:54 |it is not good . it must be changed , i think .| a9d-uW4STnk
_*32072 4:59 |sarah : it does not stop in brunnsparken said those on the speakers . it goes through centralstationen .| a9d-uW4STnk
_*32073 5:06 |nicklas : there is no information on any screen ?| a9d-uW4STnk
_*32074 5:07 |sarah : i know . should we get of at centralstationen and walk ?| a9d-uW4STnk
_*32075 5:12 |nicklas : ok .| a9d-uW4STnk
_*32076 5:16 |at hotels for example , where they do not have facilities for the hearing impaired at night .| a9d-uW4STnk
_*32077 5:25 |if the fire alarm would start , how to do ?| a9d-uW4STnk
_*32078 5:31 |i have asked my sisters who works at the hotel . i asked them what do you do ?| a9d-uW4STnk
_*32079 5:36 |they said that the staff can not go in and wake the guests up .| a9d-uW4STnk
_*32080 5:47 |just go to the assembly point and count all the guests .| a9d-uW4STnk
_*32081 5:52 |but ...| a9d-uW4STnk
_*32082 5:54 |do you think i want to bring my own hearing tools into a bag and carry them with me ?| a9d-uW4STnk
_*32083 6:01 |no !| a9d-uW4STnk

_*32102 0:10 |the people in the back , can you hear me clearly ?| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32103 0:13 |ok , good .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32104 0:15 |have you ever held a question in mind| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32105 0:19 |for so long that it becomes part of how you think ?| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32106 0:25 |maybe even part of who you are as a person ?| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32107 0:28 |well i 've had a question in my mind for many , many years| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32108 0:32 |and that is : how can you speed up learning ?| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32109 0:38 |now , this is an interesting question| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32110 0:40 |because if you speed up learning ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32111 0:42 |you can spend less time at school .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32112 0:44 |and if you learn really fast ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32113 0:47 |you probably would n't have to go to school at all .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32114 0:50 |now , when i was young , school was sort of ok but ...| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32115 0:54 |i found quite often that school got in the way of learning| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32116 0:58 |so i had this question in mind : how do you learn faster ?| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32117 1:02 |and this began when i was very , very young ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32118 1:05 |when i was 11 years old ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32119 1:07 |i wrote a letter to researchers in the soviet union , asking about hypnopaedia ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32120 1:11 |this is sleep-learning ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32121 1:13 |where you get a tape recorder , you put it beside your bed| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32122 1:16 |and it turns on in the middle of the night| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32123 1:19 |when you 're sleeping ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32124 1:20 |and you 're supposed to be learning from this .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32125 1:22 |a good idea , unfortunately it does n't work .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32126 1:25 |but , hypnopaedia did open the doors to research in other areas| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32127 1:29 |and we 've had incredible discoveries about| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32128 1:32 |learning that began with that first question .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32129 1:36 |i went on from there to become passionate about psychology| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32130 1:39 |and i have been involved in psychology in many different ways| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32131 1:43 |for the rest of my life up until this point .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32132 1:45 |in 1981 , i took myself to china| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32133 1:49 |and i decided that i was going to be native level in chinese inside two years .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32134 1:56 |now , you need to understand that in 1981 , everybody thought| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32135 2:01 |chinese was really , really difficult| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32136 2:04 |and that a westerner could study for 10 years or more| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32137 2:06 |and never really get very good at it .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32138 2:08 |and i also went in with a different idea| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32139 2:11 |which was : taking all of the conclusions| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32140 2:13 |from psychological research up to that point| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32141 2:16 |and applying them to the learning process .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32142 2:19 |what was really cool was that in six months i was fluent in mandarin chinese| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32143 2:24 |and it took a little bit longer to get up to native .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32144 2:28 |but i looked around and i saw all of these people from different countries| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32145 2:33 |struggling terribly with chinese ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32146 2:35 |i saw chinese people struggling terribly to learn english and other languages ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32147 2:40 |and so my question got refined down to :| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32148 2:44 |how can you help a normal adult| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32149 2:47 |learn a new language quickly , easily and effectively ?| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32150 2:51 |now this is a really , really important question in today 's world .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32151 2:54 |we have massive challenges with environment ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32152 2:56 |we have massive challenges with social dislocation ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32153 2:59 |with wars , all sorts of things going on| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32154 3:02 |and if we ca n't communicate ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32155 3:04 |we 're really going to have difficulty solving these problems .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32156 3:07 |so we need to be able to speak each other 's languages ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32157 3:10 |this is really , really important .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32158 3:12 |the question then is : how do you do that ?| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32159 3:16 |well , it 's actually really easy .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32160 3:18 |you look around for people who can already do it ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32161 3:21 |you look for situations where it 's already working| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32162 3:24 |and then you identify the principles and apply them .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32163 3:27 |it 's called modelling and i 've been looking at language learning| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32164 3:30 |and modelling language learning for about 15 to 20 years now .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32165 3:35 |and my conclusion , my observation from this is| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32166 3:38 |that any adult can learn a second language to fluency inside six months .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32167 3:43 |now when i say this , most people think i 'm crazy , this is not possible .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32168 3:49 |so let me remind everybody of the history of human progress ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32169 3:53 |it 's all about expanding our limits .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32170 3:57 |in 1950 , everybody believed that running one mile in four minutes was impossible ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32171 4:03 |and then roger bannister did it in 1956| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32172 4:06 |and from there it 's got shorter and shorter .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32173 4:09 |100 years ago everybody believed that heavy stuff does n't fly .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32174 4:12 |except it does and we all know this .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32175 4:16 |how does heavy stuff fly ?| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32176 4:18 |we reorganise the material using principles that we have learned| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32177 4:22 |from observing nature , birds in this case .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32178 4:26 |and today we 've gone even further ...| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32179 4:30 |we 've gone even further , so you can fly a car .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32180 4:34 |you can buy one of these for a couple 100.000 us dollars .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32181 4:37 |we now have cars in the world that fly .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32182 4:39 |and there 's a different way to fly which we 've learned from squirrels .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32183 4:43 |so all you need to do is copy what a flying squirrel does ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32184 4:46 |build a suit called a wing suit and off you go , you can fly like a squirrel .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32185 4:50 |now most people , a lot of people , i would n't say everybody| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32186 4:54 |but a lot of people think they ca n't draw .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32187 4:57 |however there are some key principles , five principles , that you can apply| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32188 5:01 |to learning to draw and you can actually learn to draw in five days .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32189 5:05 |so , if you draw like this , you learn these principles for five days| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32190 5:10 |and apply them and after five days you can draw something like this .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32191 5:15 |now i know this is true because that was my first drawing| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32192 5:18 |and after five days of applying these principles that was what i was able to do .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32193 5:22 |and i looked at this and i went :| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32194 5:23 |`` wow , so that 's how i look like when i 'm concentrating so intensely| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32195 5:27 |that my brain is exploding . ''| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32196 5:31 |so , anybody can learn to draw in five days| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32197 5:35 |and in the same way , with the same logic ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32198 5:37 |anybody can learn a second language in six months .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32199 5:42 |how ? there are five principles and seven actions .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32200 5:46 |there may be a few more but these are absolutely core .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32201 5:49 |and before i get into those i just want to talk about two myths ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32202 5:53 |i want to dispel two myths .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32203 5:54 |the first is that you need talent .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32204 5:56 |let me tell you about zoe .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32205 5:58 |zoe came from australia , went to holland , was trying to learn dutch ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32206 6:03 |struggling extremely , extremely ... a great deal| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32207 6:06 |and finally people were saying : `` you 're completely useless , ''| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32208 6:09 |`` you 're not talented , '' `` give up , '' `` you 're a waste of time ''| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32209 6:13 |and she was very , very depressed .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32210 6:15 |and then she came across these five principles ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32211 6:17 |she moved to brazil and she applied them| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32212 6:19 |and in six months she was fluent in portuguese ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32213 6:22 |so talent does n't matter .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32214 6:24 |people also think that immersion in a new country is the way to learn a language .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32215 6:28 |but look around hong kong , look at all the westerners| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32216 6:31 |who 've been here for 10 years , who do n't speak a word of chinese .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32217 6:35 |look at all the chinese living in america , britain , australia , canada| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32218 6:39 |have been there 10 , 20 years and they do n't speak any english .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32219 6:43 |immersion per se does not work .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32220 6:45 |why ? because a drowning man can not learn to swim .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32221 6:49 |when you do n't speak a language , you 're like a baby .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32222 6:52 |and if you drop yourself into a context| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32223 6:54 |which is all adults talking about stuff over your head , you wo n't learn .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32224 6:59 |so , what are the five principles that you need to pay attention to ?| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32225 7:02 |first : the four words ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32226 7:04 |attention , meaning , relevance and memory ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32227 7:06 |and these interconnect in very , very important ways .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32228 7:10 |especially when you 're talking about learning .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32229 7:12 |come with me on a journey through a forest .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32230 7:14 |you go on a walk through a forest| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32231 7:17 |and you see something like this ... little marks on a tree ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32232 7:20 |maybe you pay attention , maybe you do n't .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32233 7:23 |you go another 50 metres and you see this ...| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32234 7:26 |you should be paying attention .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32235 7:29 |another 50 metres , if you have n't been paying attention , you see this ...| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32236 7:33 |and at this point , you 're paying attention .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32237 7:37 |and you 've just learned that this ... is important ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32238 7:40 |it 's relevant because it means this ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32239 7:42 |and anything that is related , any information related to your survival| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32240 7:48 |is stuff that you 're going to pay attention to| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32241 7:50 |and therefore you 're going to remember it .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32242 7:52 |if it 's related to your personal goals ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32243 7:54 |then you 're going to pay attention to it .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32244 7:56 |if it 's relevant , you 're going to remember it .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32245 7:58 |so , the first rule , first principle for learning a language| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32246 8:01 |is focus on language content that is relevant to you .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32247 8:04 |which brings us to tools .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32248 8:07 |we master tools by using tools and we learn tools the fastest| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32249 8:11 |when they are relevant to us .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32250 8:14 |so let me share a story .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32251 8:15 |a keyboard is a tool .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32252 8:18 |typing chinese a certain way , there are methods for this . that 's a tool .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32253 8:21 |i had a colleague many years ago| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32254 8:24 |who went to night school ; tuesday night , thursday night ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32255 8:27 |two hours each time , practicing at home ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32256 8:29 |she spent nine months , and she did not learn to type chinese .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32257 8:34 |and one night we had a crisis .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32258 8:36 |we had 48 hours to deliver a training manual in chinese .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32259 8:40 |and she got the job , and i can guarantee you| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32260 8:42 |in 48 hours , she learned to type chinese| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32261 8:44 |because it was relevant , it was meaningful , it was important ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32262 8:47 |she was using a tool to create value .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32263 8:50 |so the second principle for learning a language is to use your language| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32264 8:53 |as a tool to communicate right from day one .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32265 8:57 |as a kid does .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32266 8:59 |when i first arrived in china , i did n't speak a word of chinese ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32267 9:03 |and on my second week , i got to take a train ride overnight .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32268 9:07 |i spent eight hours sitting in the dining car| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32269 9:10 |talking to one of the guards on the train ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32270 9:12 |he took an interest in me for some reason ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32271 9:14 |and we just chatted all night in chinese| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32272 9:17 |and he was drawing pictures and making movements with his hands| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32273 9:20 |and facial expressions and piece by piece by piece| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32274 9:22 |i understood more and more .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32275 9:25 |but what was really cool , was two weeks later ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32276 9:28 |when people were talking chinese around me ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32277 9:30 |i was understanding some of this| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32278 9:32 |and i had n't even made any effort to learn that .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32279 9:35 |what had happened , i 'd absorbed it that night on the train ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32280 9:38 |which brings us to the third principle .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32281 9:40 |when you first understand the message ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32282 9:43 |then you will acquire the language unconsciously .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32283 9:48 |and this is really , really well documented now ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32284 9:51 |it 's something called comprehensible input .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32285 9:53 |there 's 20 or 30 years of research on this ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32286 9:55 |stephen krashen , a leader in the field ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32287 9:57 |has published all sorts of these different studies| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32288 9:59 |and this is just from one of them .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32289 10:01 |the purple bars show the scores on different tests for language .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32290 10:09 |the purple people were people who had learned by grammar and formal study ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32291 10:14 |the green ones are the ones who learned by comprehensible input .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32292 10:17 |so , comprehension works . comprehension is key| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32293 10:21 |and language learning is not about accumulating lots of knowledge .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32294 10:28 |in many , many ways it 's about physiological training .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32295 10:34 |a woman i know from taiwan did great in english at school ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32296 10:37 |she got a grades all the way through ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32297 10:39 |went through college , a grades , went to the us| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32298 10:42 |and found she could n't understand what people were saying .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32299 10:45 |and people started asking her : `` are you deaf ? ''| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32300 10:49 |and she was . english deaf .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32301 10:52 |because we have filters in our brain that filter in| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32302 10:56 |the sounds that we are familiar with| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32303 10:58 |and they filter out the sounds of languages that we 're not .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32304 11:02 |and if you ca n't hear it , you wo n't understand it ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32305 11:05 |if you ca n't understand it , you 're not going to learn it .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32306 11:07 |so you actually have to be able to hear these sounds .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32307 11:10 |and there are ways to do that but it 's physiological training .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32308 11:13 |speaking takes muscle .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32309 11:18 |you 've got 43 muscles in your face ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32310 11:21 |you have to coordinate those in a way| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32311 11:23 |that you make sounds that other people will understand .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32312 11:27 |if you 've ever done a new sport for a couple of days ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32313 11:30 |and you know how your body feels ? hurts ?| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32314 11:33 |if your face is hurting , you 're doing it right .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32315 11:38 |and the final principle is state . psycho-physiological state .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32316 11:43 |if you 're sad , angry , worried , upset , you 're not going to learn . period .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32317 11:48 |if you 're happy , relaxed , in an alpha brain state , curious ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32318 11:51 |you 're going to learn really quickly ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32319 11:53 |and very specifically you need to be tolerant of ambiguity .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32320 11:57 |if you 're one of those people who needs to understand 100 percent| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32321 12:00 |every word you 're hearing , you will go nuts ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32322 12:03 |because you 'll be incredibly upset all the time , because you 're not perfect .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32323 12:07 |if you 're comfortable with getting some , not getting some ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32324 12:11 |just paying attention to what you do understand ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32325 12:13 |you 're going to be fine , relaxed , and you 'll be learning quickly .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32326 12:16 |so based on those five principles , what are the seven actions that you take ?| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32327 12:21 |number one : listen a lot .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32328 12:23 |i call it brain soaking .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32329 12:26 |you put yourself in a context| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32330 12:27 |where you 're hearing tons and tons and tons of a language| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32331 12:31 |and it does n't matter if you understand it or not .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32332 12:33 |you 're listening to the rhythms , to patterns that repeat ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32333 12:37 |you 're listening to things that stand out .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32334 12:41 |( english ) so , just soak your brain in this .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32335 12:43 |the second action is that you get the meaning first ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32336 12:46 |even before you get the words .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32337 12:48 |you go : `` well how do i do that ? i do n't know the words ! ''| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32338 12:51 |well , you understand what these different postures mean .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32339 12:55 |human communication is body language in many , many ways , so much body language .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32340 13:00 |from body language you can understand a lot of communication ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32341 13:03 |therefore , you 're understanding , you 're acquiring through comprehensible input .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32342 13:07 |and you can also use patterns that you already know .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32343 13:11 |if you 're a chinese speaker of mandarin and cantonese and you go to vietnam ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32344 13:16 |you will understand 60 percent of what they say to you in daily conversation ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32345 13:22 |because vietnamese is about 30 percent mandarin , 30 percent cantonese .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32346 13:28 |the third action : start mixing .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32347 13:31 |you probably have never thought of this| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32348 13:33 |but if you 've got 10 verbs , 10 nouns and 10 adjectives ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32349 13:36 |you can say 1000 different things .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32350 13:39 |language is a creative process .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32351 13:43 |what do babies do ? ok , `` me '' , `` bath '' , `` now '' .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32352 13:47 |ok , that 's how they communicate .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32353 13:49 |so start mixing , get creative , have fun with it ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32354 13:51 |it does n't have to be perfect , just has to work .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32355 13:55 |and when you 're doing this , you focus on the core .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32356 13:58 |what does that mean ?| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32357 13:59 |well , any language is high frequency content .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32358 14:02 |in english 1000 words covers 85 percent| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32359 14:06 |of anything you 're ever going to say in daily communication .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32360 14:09 |3000 words gives you 98 percent| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32361 14:12 |of anything you 're going to say in daily conversation .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32362 14:14 |you got 3000 words , you 're speaking the language .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32363 14:17 |the rest is icing on the cake .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32364 14:20 |and when you 're just beginning with a new language ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32365 14:22 |start with your tool box . week number one ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32366 14:26 |in your new language you say things like :| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32367 14:28 |`` how do you say that ? '' `` i do n't understand , ''| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32368 14:30 |`` repeat that please , '' `` what does that mean ? ''| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32369 14:33 |all in your target language .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32370 14:34 |you 're using it as a tool , making it useful to you ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32371 14:37 |it 's relevant to learn other things about the language .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32372 14:41 |by week two , you should be saying things like :| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32373 14:43 |`` me , '' `` this , '' `` you , '' `` that , '' `` give , '' you know , `` hot , ''| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32374 14:47 |simple pronouns , simple nouns , simple verbs ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32375 14:51 |simple adjectives , communicating like a baby .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32376 14:54 |and by the third or fourth week , you 're getting into `` glue words . ''| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32377 14:59 |`` although , '' `` but , '' `` therefore , '' these are logical transformers| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32378 15:03 |that tie bits of a language together , allowing you to make more complex meaning .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32379 15:08 |at that point you 're talking .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32380 15:10 |and when you 're doing that , you should get yourself a language parent .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32381 15:15 |if you look at how children and parents interact ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32382 15:18 |you 'll understand what this means .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32383 15:21 |when a child is speaking , it 'll be using simple words , simple combinations ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32384 15:24 |sometimes quite strange , sometimes very strange pronunciation ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32385 15:28 |other people from outside the family do n't understand it .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32386 15:32 |but the parents do .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32387 15:34 |and so the kid has a safe environment , gets confidence .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32388 15:39 |the parents talk to the children with body language| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32389 15:42 |and with simple language they know the child understands .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32390 15:45 |so you have a comprehensible input environment that 's safe ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32391 15:48 |we know it works ; otherwise none of you would speak your mother tongue .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32392 15:52 |so you get yourself a language parent ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32393 15:54 |who 's somebody interested in you as a person| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32394 15:56 |who will communicate with you essentially as an equal ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32395 15:59 |but pay attention to help you understand the message .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32396 16:04 |there are four rules of a language parent .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32397 16:06 |spouses are not very good at this , ok ?| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32398 16:08 |but the four rules are ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32399 16:09 |first of all , they will work hard to understand what you mean| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32400 16:12 |even when you 're way off beat .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32401 16:15 |secondly , they will never correct your mistakes .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32402 16:18 |thirdly , they will feed back their understanding of what you are saying| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32403 16:22 |so that you can respond appropriately and get that feedback| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32404 16:26 |and then they will use words that you know .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32405 16:29 |the sixth thing you have to do , is copy the face .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32406 16:33 |you got to get the muscles working right ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32407 16:35 |so you can sound in a way that people will understand you .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32408 16:39 |there 's a couple of things you do .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32409 16:40 |one is that you hear how it feels , and feel how it sounds| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32410 16:44 |which means you have a feedback loop operating in your face ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32411 16:47 |but ideally if you can look at a native speaker| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32412 16:50 |and just observe how they use their face ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32413 16:52 |let your unconscious mind absorb the rules ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32414 16:55 |then you 're going to be able to pick it up .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32415 16:57 |and if you ca n't get a native speaker to look at , you can use stuff like this ...| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32416 17:02 |( female voice ) sing , song , king , stung , hung .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32417 17:12 |( chris lonsdale ) and the final idea here , the final action you need to take| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32418 17:16 |is something that i call `` direct connect '' .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32419 17:18 |what does this mean ? well most people learning a second language| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32420 17:21 |sort of take the mother tongue words and the target words and go over them| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32421 17:24 |again and again in their mind to try and remember them . really inefficient .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32422 17:28 |what you need to do is realise that| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32423 17:31 |everything you know is an image inside your mind , it 's feelings ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32424 17:34 |if you talk about fire , you can smell the smoke ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32425 17:36 |you can hear the crackling , you can see the flames ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32426 17:39 |so what you do , is you go into that imagery and all of that memory| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32427 17:42 |and you come out with another pathway . so i call it `` same box , different path '' .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32428 17:47 |you come out of that pathway and you build it over time ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32429 17:50 |you become more and more skilled at just connecting the new sounds| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32430 17:53 |to those images that you already have , into that internal representation .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32431 17:58 |and over time you even become naturally good at that process ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32432 18:01 |that becomes unconscious .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32433 18:03 |so , there are five principles that you need to work with , seven actions ,| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32434 18:08 |if you do any of them , you 're going to improve .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32435 18:10 |and remember these are things under your control as the learner .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32436 18:14 |do them all and you 're going to be fluent in a second language in six months .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32437 18:17 |thank you .| d0yGdNEWdn0
_*32438 18:19 |( applause )| d0yGdNEWdn0

_*32522 2:05 |my boss made sure that i could do these things then went ahead and hired me .| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32523 2:10 |i passed certifications , and i am familiar with collision and mechanic work .| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32524 2:16 |i worked here at church brothers for 10 years .| S_aYaH6iUQQ

_*32528 2:42 |my markings are in green color .| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32529 2:45 |if marked `` x '' that means it needs replacement .| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32530 2:48 |if marked `` o '' that means the damage needs to be fixed , and these marks show the damages .| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32531 2:56 |sometimes insurance companies come and take a look .| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32532 2:59 |the insurance companies ' markings are orange .| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32533 3:02 |our markings are different . we communicate| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32534 3:05 |and agree to work out the details , to go ahead and fix .| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32535 3:09 |sometimes insurance companies ask me why it needs replacement , and i explain| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32536 3:11 |that the crash was bad , and damage too severe , so it has to be replaced .| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32537 3:22 |this is the old damaged part , and it has been removed .| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32538 3:28 |it has been replaced with a new part installed here .| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32539 3:38 |okay ... insurance company comes here and discuss with me and my manager .| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32540 3:42 |as we meet , they wanted me to fix the rail| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32541 3:48 |while me and my manager wanted to replace it .| S_aYaH6iUQQ

_*32543 3:52 |and i still wanted to replace .| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32544 3:54 |so i give the insurance company an example .| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32545 3:57 |if the rail has been crushed| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32546 3:59 |like this can ...| S_aYaH6iUQQ

_*32551 4:37 |now it is weak .| S_aYaH6iUQQ

_*32553 4:44 |strong .| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32554 4:49 |it is strong .| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32555 4:51 |that is what i try to explain clearly to the insurance company .| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32556 4:54 |so they agree to go ahead and replace the rail .| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32557 4:59 |we rather it to be strong than doing the repair because in the second crash it would be weak .| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32558 5:10 |i make calls with this , and communicate through sorenson vrs .| S_aYaH6iUQQ

_*32569 6:06 |then the car goes to the body shop for assembly until it is done .| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32570 6:11 |then it goes for a wash , and the customer picks it up .| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32571 6:19 |he paints this area to this point to blend .| S_aYaH6iUQQ
_*32572 6:24 |when finished , he uses clearcoat paint to match the color . that 's it .| S_aYaH6iUQQ

_*33756 2:23 |well , ah , huuuh . yes , those are the main items on the agenda .| tGCYDGxJajc
_*33757 2:31 |as to communication on means of prevention ,| tGCYDGxJajc
_*33758 2:34 |do you feel that there are messages that need to be conveyed more effectively ?| tGCYDGxJajc
_*33759 2:38 |in other words , do some messages not get over to people sufficiently ?| tGCYDGxJajc
_*33760 2:41 |studies demonstrate that , eh , fidelity ... the question of fidelity is difficult still , huhhh .| tGCYDGxJajc
_*33761 2:52 |many people maintain that fidelity is their chosen means of prevention against hiv/aids ,| tGCYDGxJajc
_*33762 2:58 |but they can have difficulty overcoming certain challenges in everyday life , uhhh .| tGCYDGxJajc

_*33768 3:13 |well you see , being faithful to one 's partner all the time is an exercise in self-control .| tGCYDGxJajc
_*33769 3:19 |you have to have the strength of character to say no to temptation .| tGCYDGxJajc
_*33770 3:22 |each of us should stop and think| tGCYDGxJajc
_*33771 3:24 |in order to produce a personalized strategy , to cope with these challenges . oooh !| tGCYDGxJajc
_*33772 3:36 |doctor , do you have a final comment ?| tGCYDGxJajc
_*33773 3:39 |yes . fidelity observed in a couple helps protect our families against aids ,| tGCYDGxJajc
_*33774 3:46 |to help ensure that our babies are n't born with hiv .| tGCYDGxJajc
_*33775 3:50 |each of us must learn to behave responsibly . it 's a question of your strength of character .| tGCYDGxJajc

_*33895 0:13 |chris anderson : so , this is an interview with a difference .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33896 0:16 |on the basis that a picture is worth a thousand words ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33897 0:21 |what i did was , i asked bill and melinda| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33898 0:23 |to dig out from their archive| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33899 0:26 |some images that would help explain| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33900 0:28 |some of what they 've done ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33901 0:29 |and do a few things that way .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33902 0:32 |so , we 're going to start here .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33903 0:35 |melinda , when and where was this ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33904 0:38 |and who is that handsome man next to you ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33905 0:40 |melinda gates : with those big glasses , huh ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33906 0:42 |this is in africa , our very first trip ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33907 0:44 |the first time either of us had ever been to africa ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33908 0:46 |in the fall of 1993 .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33909 0:47 |we were already engaged to be married .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33910 0:49 |we married a few months later ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33911 0:51 |and this was the trip where we really went to see| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33912 0:53 |the animals and to see the savanna .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33913 0:55 |it was incredible . bill had never taken that much time| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33914 0:57 |off from work .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33915 0:58 |but what really touched us , actually , were the people ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33916 1:03 |and the extreme poverty .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33917 1:06 |we started asking ourselves questions .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33918 1:07 |does it have to be like this ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33919 1:09 |and at the end of the trip ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33920 1:10 |we went out to zanzibar ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33921 1:11 |and took some time to walk on the beach ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33922 1:13 |which is something we had done a lot| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33923 1:14 |while we were dating .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33924 1:15 |and we 'd already been talking about during that time| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33925 1:18 |that the wealth that had come from microsoft| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33926 1:20 |would be given back to society ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33927 1:21 |but it was really on that beach walk| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33928 1:23 |that we started to talk about , well ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33929 1:25 |what might we do and how might we go about it ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33930 1:28 |ca : so , given that this vacation| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33931 1:31 |led to the creation of| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33932 1:33 |the world 's biggest private foundation ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33933 1:36 |it 's pretty expensive as vacations go . ( laughter )| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33934 1:39 |mg : i guess so . we enjoyed it .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33935 1:41 |ca : which of you was the key instigator here ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33936 1:44 |or was it symmetrical ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33937 1:47 |bill gates : well , i think we were excited| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33938 1:50 |that there 'd be a phase of our life| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33939 1:51 |where we 'd get to work together| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33940 1:53 |and figure out how to give this money back .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33941 2:00 |at this stage , we were talking about the poorest ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33942 2:03 |and could you have a big impact on them ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33943 2:05 |were there things that were n't being done ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33944 2:07 |there was a lot we did n't know .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33945 2:11 |when we look back on it .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33946 2:12 |but we had a certain enthusiasm| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33947 2:14 |that that would be the phase ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33948 2:17 |the post-microsoft phase| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33949 2:20 |would be our philanthropy .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33950 2:22 |mg : which bill always thought was going to come| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33951 2:24 |after he was 60 ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33952 2:25 |so he has n't quite hit 60 yet ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33953 2:27 |so some things change along the way .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33954 2:30 |ca : so it started there , but it got accelerated .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33955 2:32 |so that was '93 , and it was '97 , really ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33956 2:35 |before the foundation itself started .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33957 2:37 |ma : yeah , in '97 , we read an article| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33958 2:39 |about diarrheal diseases killing so many kids around the world ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33959 2:42 |and we kept saying to ourselves ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33960 2:44 |`` well that ca n't be .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33961 2:45 |in the u.s. , you just go down to the drug store . ''| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33962 2:47 |and so we started gathering scientists| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33963 2:49 |and started learning about population ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33964 2:52 |learning about vaccines ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33965 2:53 |learning about what had worked and what had failed ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33966 2:55 |and that 's really when we got going ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33967 2:57 |was in late 1998 , 1999 .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33968 3:02 |ca : so , you 've got a big pot of money| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33969 3:04 |and a world full of so many different issues .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33970 3:07 |how on earth do you decide what to focus on ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33971 3:11 |bg : well , we decided that we 'd pick two causes ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33972 3:14 |whatever the biggest inequity was globally ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33973 3:16 |and there we looked at children dying ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33974 3:19 |children not having enough nutrition to ever develop ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33975 3:21 |and countries that were really stuck ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33976 3:23 |because with that level of death ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33977 3:25 |and parents would have so many kids| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33978 3:27 |that they 'd get huge population growth ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33979 3:29 |and that the kids were so sick| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33980 3:32 |that they really could n't be educated| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33981 3:34 |and lift themselves up .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33982 3:36 |so that was our global thing ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33983 3:37 |and then in the u.s. ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33984 3:40 |both of us have had amazing educations ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33985 3:43 |and we saw that as the way that the u.s .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33986 3:46 |could live up to its promise of equal opportunity| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33987 3:49 |is by having a phenomenal education system ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33988 3:52 |and the more we learned , the more we realized| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33989 3:54 |we 're not really fulfilling that promise .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33990 3:57 |and so we picked those two things ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33991 3:58 |and everything the foundation does| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33992 4:00 |is focused there .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33993 4:03 |ca : so , i asked each of you to pick an image| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33994 4:05 |that you like that illustrates your work ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33995 4:08 |and melinda , this is what you picked .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33996 4:11 |what 's this about ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33997 4:12 |mg : so i , one of the things i love to do when i travel| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33998 4:15 |is to go out to the rural areas and talk to the women ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*33999 4:19 |whether it 's bangladesh , india , lots of countries in africa ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34000 4:21 |and i go in as a western woman without a name .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34001 4:24 |i do n't tell them who i am . pair of khakis .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34002 4:27 |and i kept hearing from women ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34003 4:28 |over and over and over , the more i traveled ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34004 4:31 |`` i want to be able to use this shot . ''| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34005 4:34 |i would be there to talk to them about childhood vaccines ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34006 4:36 |and they would bring the conversation around to| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34007 4:39 |`` but what about the shot i get ? ''| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34008 4:41 |which is an injection they were getting called depo-provera ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34009 4:43 |which is a contraceptive .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34010 4:45 |and i would come back and talk to global health experts ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34011 4:47 |and they 'd say , `` oh no , contraceptives| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34012 4:49 |are stocked in in the developing world . ''| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34013 4:51 |well , you had to dig deeper into the reports ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34014 4:53 |and this is what the team came to me with ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34015 4:55 |which is , to have the number one thing| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34016 4:57 |that women tell you in africa they want to use| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34017 5:00 |stocked out more than 200 days a year| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34018 5:03 |explains why women were saying to me ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34019 5:05 |`` i walked 10 kilometers without my husband knowing it ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34020 5:09 |and i got to the clinic , and there was nothing there . ''| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34021 5:12 |and so condoms were stocked in in africa| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34022 5:15 |because of all the aids work that the u.s .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34023 5:17 |and others supported .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34024 5:18 |but women will tell you over and over again ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34025 5:20 |`` i ca n't negotiate a condom with my husband .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34026 5:23 |i 'm either suggesting he has aids or i have aids ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34027 5:27 |and i need that tool because then i can space| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34028 5:30 |the births of my children , and i can feed them| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34029 5:32 |and have a chance of educating them . ''| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34030 5:35 |ca : melinda , you 're roman catholic ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34031 5:37 |and you 've often been embroiled| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34032 5:40 |in controversy over this issue ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34033 5:42 |and on the abortion question ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34034 5:44 |on both sides , really .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34035 5:46 |how do you navigate that ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34036 5:48 |mg : yeah , so i think that 's a really important point ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34037 5:51 |which is , we had backed away from contraceptives| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34038 5:54 |as a global community .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34039 5:55 |we knew that 210 million women| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34040 5:58 |were saying they wanted access to contraceptives ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34041 6:00 |even the contraceptives we have here in the united states ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34042 6:03 |and we were n't providing them| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34043 6:05 |because of the political controversy in our country ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34044 6:09 |and to me that was just a crime ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34045 6:11 |and i kept looking around trying to find the person| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34046 6:14 |that would get this back on the global stage ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34047 6:16 |and i finally realized i just had to do it .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34048 6:18 |and even though i 'm catholic ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34049 6:20 |i believe in contraceptives| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34050 6:22 |just like most of the catholic women in the united states| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34051 6:24 |who report using contraceptives ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34052 6:26 |and i should n't let that controversy| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34053 6:28 |be the thing that holds us back .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34054 6:30 |we used to have consensus in the united states| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34055 6:32 |around contraceptives ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34056 6:33 |and so we got back to that global consensus ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34057 6:35 |and actually raised 2.6 billion dollars| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34058 6:38 |around exactly this issue for women .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34059 6:41 |( applause )| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34060 6:49 |ca : bill , this is your graph . what 's this about ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34061 6:53 |bg : well , my graph has numbers on it .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34062 6:55 |( laughter )| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34063 6:57 |i really like this graph .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34064 6:59 |this is the number of children| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34065 7:02 |who die before the age of five every year .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34066 7:04 |and what you find is really| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34067 7:06 |a phenomenal success story| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34068 7:08 |which is not widely known ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34069 7:10 |that we are making incredible progress .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34070 7:13 |we go from 20 million| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34071 7:15 |not long after i was born| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34072 7:17 |to now we 're down to about six million .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34073 7:20 |so this is a story| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34074 7:23 |largely of vaccines .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34075 7:24 |smallpox was killing a couple million kids a year .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34076 7:27 |that was eradicated , so that got down to zero .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34077 7:30 |measles was killing a couple million a year .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34078 7:31 |that 's down to a few hundred thousand .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34079 7:33 |anyway , this is a chart| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34080 7:35 |where you want to get that number to continue ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34081 7:39 |and it 's going to be possible ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34082 7:41 |using the science of new vaccines ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34083 7:43 |getting the vaccines out to kids .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34084 7:45 |we can actually accelerate the progress .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34085 7:46 |the last decade ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34086 7:48 |that number has dropped faster| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34087 7:50 |than ever in history ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34088 7:52 |and so i just love the fact that| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34089 7:55 |you can say , okay , if we can invent new vaccines ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34090 7:57 |we can get them out there ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34091 7:58 |use the very latest understanding of these things ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34092 8:01 |and get the delivery right , that we can perform a miracle .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34093 8:05 |ca : i mean , you do the math on this ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34094 8:07 |and it works out , i think , literally| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34095 8:09 |to thousands of kids ' lives saved every day| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34096 8:11 |compared to the prior year .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34097 8:13 |it 's not reported .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34098 8:15 |an airliner with 200-plus deaths| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34099 8:18 |is a far , far bigger story than that .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34100 8:20 |does that drive you crazy ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34101 8:22 |bg : yeah , because it 's a silent thing going on .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34102 8:25 |it 's a kid , one kid at a time .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34103 8:27 |ninety-eight percent of this| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34104 8:29 |has nothing to do with natural disasters ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34105 8:31 |and yet , people 's charity ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34106 8:32 |when they see a natural disaster , are wonderful .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34107 8:34 |it 's incredible how people think , okay ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34108 8:36 |that could be me , and the money flows .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34109 8:39 |these causes have been a bit invisible .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34110 8:42 |now that the millennium development goals| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34111 8:44 |and various things are getting out there ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34112 8:46 |we are seeing some increased generosity ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34113 8:49 |so the goal is to get this well below a million ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34114 8:52 |which should be possible in our lifetime .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34115 8:54 |ca : maybe it needed someone| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34116 8:55 |who is turned on by numbers and graphs| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34117 8:58 |rather than just the big , sad face| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34118 9:00 |to get engaged .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34119 9:02 |i mean , you 've used it in your letter this year ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34120 9:03 |you used basically this argument to say that aid ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34121 9:07 |contrary to the current meme| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34122 9:08 |that aid is kind of worthless and broken ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34123 9:12 |that actually it has been effective .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34124 9:13 |bg : yeah , well people can take ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34125 9:15 |there is some aid that was well-meaning| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34126 9:19 |and did n't go well .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34127 9:21 |there 's some venture capital investments| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34128 9:23 |that were well-meaning and did n't go well .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34129 9:25 |you should n't just say , okay , because of that ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34130 9:28 |because we do n't have a perfect record ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34131 9:31 |this is a bad endeavor .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34132 9:33 |you should look at , what was your goal ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34133 9:35 |how are you trying to uplift nutrition| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34134 9:37 |and survival and literacy| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34135 9:41 |so these countries can take care of themselves ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34136 9:42 |and say wow , this is going well ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34137 9:44 |and be smarter .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34138 9:46 |we can spend aid smarter .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34139 9:48 |it is not all a panacea .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34140 9:51 |we can do better than venture capital , i think ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34141 9:54 |including big hits like this .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34142 9:57 |ca : traditional wisdom is that| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34143 9:59 |it 's pretty hard for married couples to work together .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34144 10:03 |how have you guys managed it ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34145 10:05 |mg : yeah , i 've had a lot of women say to me ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34146 10:07 |`` i really do n't think i could work with my husband .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34147 10:09 |that just would n't work out . ''| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34148 10:11 |you know , we enjoy it , and we do n't --| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34149 10:14 |this foundation has been a coming to for both of us| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34150 10:17 |in its continuous learning journey ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34151 10:20 |and we do n't travel together as much| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34152 10:22 |for the foundation , actually , as we used to| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34153 10:24 |when bill was working at microsoft .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34154 10:26 |we have more trips where we 're traveling separately ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34155 10:28 |but i always know when i come home ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34156 10:30 |bill 's going to be interested in what i learned ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34157 10:32 |whether it 's about women or girls| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34158 10:34 |or something new about the vaccine delivery chain ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34159 10:37 |or this person that is a great leader .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34160 10:39 |he 's going to listen and be really interested .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34161 10:41 |and he knows when he comes home ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34162 10:43 |even if it 's to talk about the speech he did| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34163 10:45 |or the data or what he 's learned ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34164 10:47 |i 'm really interested ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34165 10:48 |and i think we have a really collaborative relationship .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34166 10:51 |but we do n't every minute together , that 's for sure .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34167 10:53 |( laughter )| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34168 10:58 |ca : but now you are , and we 're very happy that you are .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34169 11:00 |melinda , early on , you were basically| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34170 11:04 |largely running the show .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34171 11:06 |six years ago , i guess ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34172 11:07 |bill came on full time , so moved from microsoft| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34173 11:09 |and became full time .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34174 11:11 |that must have been hard ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34175 11:12 |adjusting to that . no ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34176 11:14 |mg : yeah . i think actually ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34177 11:17 |for the foundation employees ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34178 11:19 |there was way more angst for them| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34179 11:21 |than there was for me about bill coming .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34180 11:23 |i was actually really excited .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34181 11:24 |i mean , bill made this decision| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34182 11:25 |even obviously before it got announced in 2006 ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34183 11:28 |and it was really his decision ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34184 11:30 |but again , it was a beach vacation| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34185 11:32 |where we were walking on the beach| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34186 11:33 |and he was starting to think of this idea .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34187 11:35 |and for me , the excitement of bill| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34188 11:38 |putting his brain and his heart| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34189 11:41 |against these huge global problems ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34190 11:43 |these inequities , to me that was exciting .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34191 11:45 |yes , the foundation employees had angst about that .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34192 11:49 |( applause )| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34193 11:51 |ca : that 's cool .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34194 11:53 |mg : but that went away within three months ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34195 11:54 |once he was there .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34196 11:55 |bg : including some of the employees .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34197 11:57 |mg : that 's what i said , the employees ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34198 11:58 |it went away for them three months after you were there .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34199 12:00 |bg : no , i 'm kidding . mg : oh , you mean , the employees did n't go away .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34200 12:05 |( laughter )| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34201 12:06 |ca : so what do you guys argue about ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34202 12:08 |sunday , 11 o'clock ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34203 12:11 |you 're away from work ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34204 12:12 |what comes up ? what 's the argument ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34205 12:15 |bg : because we built this thing| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34206 12:17 |together from the beginning ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34207 12:20 |it 's this great partnership .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34208 12:21 |i had that with paul allen| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34209 12:23 |in the early days of microsoft .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34210 12:25 |i had it with steve ballmer as microsoft got bigger ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34211 12:28 |and now melinda , and in even stronger ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34212 12:31 |equal ways , is the partner ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34213 12:33 |so we talk a lot about| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34214 12:35 |which things should we give more to ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34215 12:37 |which groups are working well ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34216 12:39 |she 's got a lot of insight .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34217 12:41 |she 'll sit down with the employees a lot .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34218 12:42 |we 'll take the different trips she described .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34219 12:44 |so there 's a lot of collaboration .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34220 12:48 |i ca n't think of anything where one of us| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34221 12:50 |had a super strong opinion| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34222 12:53 |about one thing or another ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34223 12:55 |ca : how about you , melinda , though ? can you ? ( laughter )| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34224 12:58 |you never know .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34225 12:59 |mg : well , here 's the thing .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34226 13:01 |we come at things from different angles ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34227 13:02 |and i actually think that 's really good .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34228 13:04 |so bill can look at the big data| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34229 13:06 |and say , `` i want to act based on these global statistics . ''| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34230 13:09 |for me , i come at it from intuition .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34231 13:11 |i meet with lots of people on the ground| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34232 13:13 |and bill 's taught me to take that| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34233 13:15 |and read up to the global data and see if they match ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34234 13:18 |and i think what i 've taught him| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34235 13:19 |is to take that data| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34236 13:20 |and meet with people on the ground to understand ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34237 13:22 |can you actually deliver that vaccine ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34238 13:24 |can you get a woman to accept those polio drops| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34239 13:27 |in her child 's mouth ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34240 13:29 |because the delivery piece| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34241 13:30 |is every bit as important as the science .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34242 13:32 |so i think it 's been more a coming to over time| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34243 13:35 |towards each other 's point of view ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34244 13:36 |and quite frankly , the work is better because of it .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34245 13:40 |ca : so , in vaccines and polio and so forth ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34246 13:42 |you 've had some amazing successes .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34247 13:46 |what about failure , though ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34248 13:47 |can you talk about a failure| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34249 13:49 |and maybe what you 've learned from it ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34250 13:51 |bg : yeah . fortunately , we can afford a few failures ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34251 13:53 |because we 've certainly had them .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34252 13:55 |we do a lot of drug work or vaccine work| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34253 14:00 |that you know you 're going to have different failures .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34254 14:03 |like , we put out , one that got a lot of publicity| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34255 14:05 |was asking for a better condom .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34256 14:07 |well , we got hundreds of ideas .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34257 14:08 |maybe a few of those will work out .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34258 14:15 |for a disease in india , visceral leishmaniasis ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34259 14:17 |that i thought , once i got this drug ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34260 14:19 |we can just go wipe out the disease .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34261 14:20 |well , turns out it took an injection| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34262 14:23 |every day for 10 days .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34263 14:24 |it took three more years to get it than we expected ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34264 14:27 |and then there was no way| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34265 14:28 |it was going to get out there .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34266 14:31 |fortunately , we found out| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34267 14:32 |that if you go kill the sand flies ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34268 14:35 |you probably can have success there ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34269 14:37 |but we spent five years ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34270 14:39 |you could say wasted five years ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34271 14:40 |and about 60 million ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34272 14:42 |on a path that turned out to have| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34273 14:44 |very modest benefit when we got there .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34274 14:48 |ca : you 're spending , like , a billion dollars a year| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34275 14:51 |in education , i think , something like that .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34276 14:53 |is anything , the story of what 's gone right there| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34277 14:57 |is quite a long and complex one .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34278 15:00 |are there any failures that you can talk about ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34279 15:04 |mg : well , i would say a huge lesson for us| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34280 15:05 |out of the early work is we thought| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34281 15:07 |that these small schools were the answer ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34282 15:09 |and small schools definitely help .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34283 15:11 |they bring down the dropout rate .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34284 15:12 |they have less violence and crime in those schools .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34285 15:15 |but the thing that we learned from that work ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34286 15:17 |and what turned out to be the fundamental key ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34287 15:20 |is a great teacher in front of the classroom .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34288 15:22 |if you do n't have an effective teacher| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34289 15:23 |in the front of the classroom ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34290 15:24 |i do n't care how big or small the building is ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34291 15:26 |you 're not going to change the trajectory| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34292 15:28 |of whether that student will be ready for college .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34293 15:30 |( applause )| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34294 15:35 |ca : so melinda , this is you and| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34295 15:37 |your eldest daughter , jenn .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34296 15:40 |and just taken about three weeks ago , i think ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34297 15:42 |three or four weeks ago . where was this ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34298 15:44 |mg : so we went to tanzania .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34299 15:46 |jenn 's been to tanzania .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34300 15:47 |all our kids have been to africa quite a bit , actually .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34301 15:49 |and we did something very different ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34302 15:51 |which is , we decided to go spend| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34303 15:53 |two nights and three days with a family .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34304 15:56 |anna and sanare are the parents .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34305 15:59 |they invited us to come and stay in their boma .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34306 16:02 |actually , the goats had been there , i think ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34307 16:03 |living in that particular little hut| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34308 16:05 |on their little compound before we got there .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34309 16:07 |and we stayed with their family ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34310 16:09 |and we really , really learned| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34311 16:11 |what life is like in rural tanzania .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34312 16:13 |and the difference between just going| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34313 16:14 |and visiting for half a day| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34314 16:16 |or three quarters of a day| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34315 16:18 |versus staying overnight was profound ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34316 16:20 |and so let me just give you one explanation of that .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34317 16:23 |they had six children , and as i talked to anna| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34318 16:26 |in the kitchen , we cooked for about five hours| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34319 16:27 |in the cooking hut that day ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34320 16:29 |and as i talked to her , she had absolutely planned| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34321 16:31 |and spaced with her husband| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34322 16:32 |the births of their children .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34323 16:34 |it was a very loving relationship .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34324 16:35 |this was a maasai warrior and his wife ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34325 16:38 |but they had decided to get married ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34326 16:40 |they clearly had respect and love in the relationship .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34327 16:43 |their children , their six children ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34328 16:44 |the two in the middle were twins , 13 ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34329 16:47 |a boy , and a girl named grace .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34330 16:49 |and when we 'd go out to chop wood| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34331 16:51 |and do all the things that grace and her mother would do ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34332 16:53 |grace was not a child , she was an adolescent ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34333 16:56 |but she was n't an adult .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34334 16:57 |she was very , very shy .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34335 16:59 |so she kept wanting to talk to me and jenn .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34336 17:01 |we kept trying to engage her , but she was shy .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34337 17:04 |and at night , though ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34338 17:05 |when all the lights went out in rural tanzania ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34339 17:08 |and there was no moon that night ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34340 17:10 |the first night , and no stars ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34341 17:11 |and jenn came out of our hut| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34342 17:13 |with her rei little headlamp on ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34343 17:16 |grace went immediately ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34344 17:18 |and got the translator ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34345 17:19 |came straight up to my jenn and said ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34346 17:22 |`` when you go home ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34347 17:23 |can i have your headlamp| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34348 17:24 |so i can study at night ? ''| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34349 17:26 |ca : oh , wow .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34350 17:27 |mg : and her dad had told me| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34351 17:28 |how afraid he was that unlike the son ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34352 17:30 |who had passed his secondary exams ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34353 17:32 |because of her chores ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34354 17:34 |she 'd not done so well| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34355 17:35 |and was n't in the government school yet .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34356 17:37 |he said , `` i do n't know how i 'm going to pay for her education .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34357 17:39 |i ca n't pay for private school ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34358 17:41 |and she may end up on this farm like my wife . ''| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34359 17:44 |so they know the difference| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34360 17:45 |that an education can make| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34361 17:46 |in a huge , profound way .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34362 17:49 |ca : i mean , this is another pic| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34363 17:50 |of your other two kids , rory and phoebe ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34364 17:54 |along with paul farmer .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34365 17:58 |bringing up three children| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34366 17:59 |when you 're the world 's richest family| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34367 18:02 |seems like a social experiment| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34368 18:05 |without much prior art .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34369 18:08 |how have you managed it ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34370 18:10 |what 's been your approach ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34371 18:12 |bg : well , i 'd say overall| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34372 18:15 |the kids get a great education ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34373 18:16 |but you 've got to make sure| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34374 18:17 |they have a sense of their own ability| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34375 18:19 |and what they 're going to go and do ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34376 18:21 |and our philosophy has been| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34377 18:23 |to be very clear with them --| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34378 18:25 |most of the money 's going to the foundation --| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34379 18:26 |and help them find something they 're excited about .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34380 18:31 |we want to strike a balance where they have| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34381 18:32 |the freedom to do anything| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34382 18:34 |but not a lot of money showered on them| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34383 18:37 |so they could go out and do nothing .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34384 18:40 |and so far , they 're fairly diligent ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34385 18:43 |excited to pick their own direction .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34386 18:46 |ca : you 've obviously guarded their privacy carefully for obvious reasons .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34387 18:52 |i 'm curious why you 've given me permission| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34388 18:54 |to show this picture now here at ted .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34389 18:56 |mg : well , it 's interesting .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34390 18:57 |as they get older , they so know| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34391 18:59 |that our family belief is about responsibility ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34392 19:02 |that we are in an unbelievable situation| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34393 19:04 |just to live in the united states| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34394 19:05 |and have a great education ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34395 19:07 |and we have a responsibility to give back to the world .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34396 19:09 |and so as they get older| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34397 19:10 |and we are teaching them --| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34398 19:14 |they 're saying ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34399 19:15 |we do want people to know that we believe| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34400 19:17 |in what you 're doing , mom and dad ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34401 19:18 |and it is okay to show us more .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34402 19:20 |so we have their permission to show this picture ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34403 19:23 |and i think paul farmer is probably going to put it| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34404 19:24 |eventually in some of his work .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34405 19:27 |but they really care deeply| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34406 19:28 |about the mission of the foundation , too .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34407 19:31 |ca : you 've easily got enough money| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34408 19:33 |despite your vast contributions to the foundation| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34409 19:35 |to make them all billionaires .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34410 19:37 |is that your plan for them ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34411 19:38 |bg : nope . no . they wo n't have anything like that .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34412 19:41 |they need to have a sense| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34413 19:43 |that their own work is meaningful and important .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34414 19:49 |we read an article long , actually , before we got married ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34415 19:53 |where warren buffett talked about that ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34416 19:55 |and we 're quite convinced that it was n't a favor| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34417 19:58 |either to society or to the kids .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34418 20:01 |ca : well , speaking of warren buffett ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34419 20:03 |something really amazing happened in 2006 ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34420 20:06 |when somehow your only real rival| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34421 20:09 |for richest person in america| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34422 20:10 |suddenly turned around and agreed to give| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34423 20:12 |80 percent of his fortune| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34424 20:14 |to your foundation .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34425 20:16 |how on earth did that happen ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34426 20:18 |i guess there 's a long version and a short version of that .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34427 20:20 |we 've got time for the short version .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34428 20:21 |bg : all right . well , warren was a close friend ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34429 20:25 |and he was going to have his wife suzie| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34430 20:29 |give it all away .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34431 20:31 |tragically , she passed away before he did ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34432 20:34 |and he 's big on delegation , and| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34433 20:42 |ca : tweet that .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34434 20:42 |bg : if he 's got somebody who is doing something well ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34435 20:46 |and is willing to do it at no charge ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34436 20:50 |maybe that 's okay . but we were stunned .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34437 20:52 |mg : totally stunned . bg : we had never expected it ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34438 20:54 |and it has been unbelievable .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34439 20:56 |it 's allowed us to increase our ambition| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34440 20:59 |in what the foundation can do quite dramatically .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34441 21:03 |half the resources we have| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34442 21:04 |come from warren 's mind-blowing generosity .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34443 21:07 |ca : and i think you 've pledged that| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34444 21:08 |by the time you 're done ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34445 21:10 |more than , or 95 percent of your wealth ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34446 21:12 |will be given to the foundation .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34447 21:14 |bg : yes .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34448 21:19 |( applause )| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34449 21:22 |and recently , you and warren| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34450 21:25 |have been going around trying to persuade| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34451 21:26 |other billionaires and successful people| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34452 21:28 |to pledge to give , what ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34453 21:30 |more than half of their assets for philanthropy .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34454 21:36 |how is that going ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34455 21:38 |bg : well , we 've got about 120 people| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34456 21:41 |who have now taken this giving pledge .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34457 21:44 |the thing that 's great is that we get together| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34458 21:46 |yearly and talk about , okay ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34459 21:48 |do you hire staff , what do you give to them ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34460 21:50 |we 're not trying to homogenize it .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34461 21:52 |i mean , the beauty of philanthropy| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34462 21:53 |is this mind-blowing diversity .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34463 21:55 |people give to some things .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34464 21:56 |we look and go , `` wow . ''| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34465 21:58 |but that 's great .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34466 22:00 |that 's the role of philanthropy| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34467 22:01 |is to pick different approaches ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34468 22:03 |including even in one space , like education .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34469 22:05 |we need more experimentation .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34470 22:08 |but it 's been wonderful , meeting those people ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34471 22:10 |sharing their journey to philanthropy ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34472 22:13 |how they involve their kids ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34473 22:14 |where they 're doing it differently ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34474 22:16 |and it 's been way more successful than we expected .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34475 22:18 |now it looks like it 'll just keep growing in size| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34476 22:21 |in the years ahead .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34477 22:24 |mg : and having people see that other people| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34478 22:27 |are making change with philanthropy ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34479 22:29 |i mean , these are people who have| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34480 22:31 |created their own businesses ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34481 22:32 |put their own ingenuity behind incredible ideas .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34482 22:35 |if they put their ideas and their brain| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34483 22:37 |behind philanthropy , they can change the world .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34484 22:40 |and they start to see others doing it , and saying ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34485 22:42 |`` wow , i want to do that with my own money . ''| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34486 22:44 |to me , that 's the piece that 's incredible .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34487 22:46 |ca : it seems to me , it 's actually really hard| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34488 22:49 |for some people to figure out| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34489 22:50 |even how to remotely spend that much money| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34490 22:53 |on something else .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34491 22:55 |there are probably some billionaires in the room| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34492 22:57 |and certainly some successful people .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34493 22:59 |i 'm curious , can you make the pitch ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34494 23:01 |what 's the pitch ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34495 23:03 |bg : well , it 's the most fulfilling thing| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34496 23:04 |we 've ever done ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34497 23:05 |and you ca n't take it with you ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34498 23:08 |and if it 's not good for your kids ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34499 23:12 |let 's get together and brainstorm| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34500 23:13 |about what we can be done .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34501 23:16 |the world is a far better place| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34502 23:18 |because of the philanthropists of the past ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34503 23:20 |and the u.s. tradition here , which is the strongest ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34504 23:23 |is the envy of the world .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34505 23:25 |and part of the reason i 'm so optimistic| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34506 23:27 |is because i do think philanthropy| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34507 23:29 |is going to grow| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34508 23:30 |and take some of these things| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34509 23:31 |government 's not just good at working on and discovering| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34510 23:34 |and shine some light in the right direction .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34511 23:38 |ca : the world 's got this terrible inequality ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34512 23:41 |growing inequality problem| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34513 23:42 |that seems structural .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34514 23:43 |it does seem to me that if more of your peers| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34515 23:46 |took the approach that you two have made ,| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34516 23:48 |it would make a dent| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34517 23:50 |both in that problem and certainly| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34518 23:51 |in the perception of that problem .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34519 23:53 |is that a fair comment ?| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34520 23:54 |bg : oh yeah . if you take from the most wealthy| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34521 23:56 |and give to the least wealthy , it 's good .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34522 23:59 |it tries to balance out , and that 's just .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34523 24:01 |mg : but you change systems .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34524 24:03 |in the u.s. , we 're trying to change the education system| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34525 24:06 |so it 's just for everybody| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34526 24:08 |and it works for all students .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34527 24:09 |that , to me , really changes| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34528 24:11 |the inequality balance .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34529 24:13 |bg : that 's the most important .| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34530 24:14 |( applause )| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34531 24:18 |ca : well , i really think that most people here| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34532 24:21 |and many millions around the world| aSL-iIskEFU
_*34533 24:23 |are just in awe of the trajectory| aSL-iIskEFU

_*34994 0:24 |i know that he slept with other women before me .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*34995 0:27 |i love him very much , but i 'm scared .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*34996 0:33 |i wonder all the time if he 's infected .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*34997 0:37 |and me as well .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*34998 0:39 |you know , every day i do try to bring up the subject of aids with him .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*34999 0:45 |it 's a matter of his health and mine .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35000 0:48 |but i never seem to be able to find the courage .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35001 0:52 |how does one begin such a discussion ?| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35002 0:56 |but , he 's your husband . you must speak to him .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35003 1:02 |what ? the aids test ? ! are you mad ?| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35004 1:08 |i would never , ever do it ! never !| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35005 1:11 |what 's the point , eh ? it 's stupid .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35006 1:13 |no , it 's not stupid . let me tell you something .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35007 1:19 |we 've decided that it 's time| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35008 1:21 |to take the hiv test before we get married .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35009 1:23 |i believe it 's good to know where you stand , do n't you ?| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35010 1:26 |to know you 're going to die tomorrow ? no thanks .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35011 1:31 |an hiv-positive test does n't mean you 've got aids ,| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35012 1:34 |nor that you 're going to die next week .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35013 1:38 |my older brother is hiv-positive .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35014 1:41 |he 's known that for a few years , and he 's doing well .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35015 1:46 |oh sure .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35016 1:47 |so give me two , three good reasons to take the test . go ahead , go !| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35017 1:51 |ok .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35018 1:54 |number one : if somebody is hiv-positive , they can see to it that they do n't infect anybody else .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35019 2:04 |if you ever find the woman of your dreams , you want to infect her ?| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35020 2:08 |my dream woman ? in the singular ? i prefer a round dozen .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35021 2:12 |nothing else ?| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35022 2:13 |not for nothing i 'm known as don juan .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35023 2:16 |yeah , whatever .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35024 2:17 |reason number two :| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35025 2:19 |a person who 's hiv-positive can live for years , if they take care of themselves .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35026 2:24 |that is to say , eat well , get enough rest , exercise , avoid alcohol and cigarettes ,| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35027 2:31 |seek medical treatment for any illnesses that might arise ,| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35028 2:34 |and above all find good sources of support .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35029 2:36 |alex , it 's no good !| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35030 2:37 |`` enough rest '' does not exactly fit in with a swinging lifestyle .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35031 2:41 |and as for giving up alcohol ...| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35032 2:43 |hey , there are also modern medicines| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35033 2:45 |that help a person who 's hiv-positive to live much longer .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35034 2:48 |more and more africans have access to them .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35035 2:51 |thirdly , bouba : children .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35036 2:53 |what ?| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35037 2:54 |i said children , babies . an hiv-positive mother can give the virus to her child .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35038 2:59 |it 's really important before having children to take the test .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35039 3:02 |but , if she 's pregnant already ? then , what is the point ?| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35040 3:07 |so , it 's crazy for her to get tested , am i right ?| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35041 3:10 |that 's not true , because in most cases| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35042 3:13 |when an hiv-positive mother gives birth to an infected child ,| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35043 3:17 |it 's during the birth itself that the infection takes place , not before .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35044 3:21 |it 's more and more common nowadays that our health workers can give inexpensive medicines| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35045 3:27 |which dramatically diminish the possibility of infection for the baby .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35046 3:31 |first they must know if the mother is hiv-positive or not .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35047 3:34 |you have to take the test .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35048 3:36 |so , an hiv-positive woman does not always pass the virus to her baby ?| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35049 3:40 |oh , no ! as i was saying , if the medical staff know she 's positive ,| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35050 3:44 |they 're able to give her these modern medicines to reduce the risk of infection for the baby .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35051 3:49 |and they can also give her advice on breast-feeding to give the child an even better chance of staying healthy .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35052 3:55 |our kids . ... that 's serious .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35053 4:12 |how 're you feeling ?| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35054 4:19 |but , he 's your husband . you must speak to him .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35055 4:44 |do n't be afraid . you two have made a very good decision .| JefK_t3JbXE
_*35056 4:49 |it 's always wise to take the test .| JefK_t3JbXE

_*35507 3:50 a Va1UPrFXHKA
_*35508 3:54 |on home| Va1UPrFXHKA
_*35509 4:01 don Va1UPrFXHKA
_*35510 4:06 do Va1UPrFXHKA
_*35511 0:04 |hi everyone , so today i 'm going to talk to you about certification for sign language| rbwsYIequfc
_*35512 0:09 |interpreters in the united states but very specifically i 'm going to talk about certifications| rbwsYIequfc
_*35513 0:14 |that are in the past . this video is going to focus on the history of the certifications| rbwsYIequfc
_*35514 0:24 |that were available in the united states . we 're not going to focus yet on what is current| rbwsYIequfc
_*35515 0:31 |because there has been a lot of issues related to certification in the past and you should| rbwsYIequfc
_*35516 0:39 |know what those certifications are . so here we go . the registry of interpreters for the| rbwsYIequfc
_*35517 0:47 |deaf , if you do n't know who that organization is you should visit their website at www.rid.org ,| rbwsYIequfc
_*35518 0:57 |www.rid.org is where the registry of interpreters for the deaf is . that is an organization that| rbwsYIequfc
_*35519 1:09 |is the founding organization for interpreting certification for sign language focused interpreters .| rbwsYIequfc
_*35520 1:22 |they are the creators of what was past certifications and what is current , at least they have been| rbwsYIequfc
_*35521 1:30 |involved in it . so , rid 's first certification was the comprehensive skills certificate or| rbwsYIequfc
_*35522 1:36 |csc . that certification was in the late 70s and essentially all throughout most of the| rbwsYIequfc
_*35523 1:45 |80s . the people who have that certification , by the way , are the real true pioneers in| rbwsYIequfc
_*35524 1:54 |the profession of interpreting so if you ever meet anybody that has a csc , you should thank| rbwsYIequfc
_*35525 1:59 |them for making it possible for you to be looked at and viewed as a professional because| rbwsYIequfc
_*35526 2:07 |when they started working it was the early days of formal interpreting and so people| rbwsYIequfc
_*35527 2:15 |thought they were friends , acquaintances , and family , which they may have been , but| rbwsYIequfc
_*35528 2:20 |they were working as professionals and they did n't get the same recognition of a profession| rbwsYIequfc
_*35529 2:28 |that you now get . they 're the ones who made it possible for you to have that perception| rbwsYIequfc
_*35530 2:32 |of being a professional . anyway , the csc is the first of the certifications with rid and| rbwsYIequfc
_*35531 2:43 |then it transitioned to the ic and/or tc and that was the interpreting certificate or transliterating| rbwsYIequfc
_*35532 2:54 |certificate . you could get both . people who have that , there are actually really only| rbwsYIequfc
_*35533 3:04 |a few because that was almost a transitional certification in itself because it was just| rbwsYIequfc
_*35534 3:10 |around for a very short time . csc came into the ic/tc and then it changed to the ci/ct| rbwsYIequfc
_*35535 3:17 |which is the certification of interpretation and certification of transliteration . if you| rbwsYIequfc
_*35536 3:31 |held both , by the way , people would perceive you as being fully certified . on a side note| rbwsYIequfc
_*35537 3:39 |related to these certifications so far , rid 's view of certification through the csc , ic/tc| rbwsYIequfc
_*35538 3:46 |and ci/ct was that the person who held that certificate in rid 's view was at least minimally| rbwsYIequfc
_*35539 3:54 |qualified . they did n't determine whether or not you were awesomely qualified , they just| rbwsYIequfc
_*35540 4:02 |made sure that if you held a certificate , you could represent yourself as being certified| rbwsYIequfc
_*35541 4:09 |but the view is you were at least minimally certified . rid has traditionally been viewed| rbwsYIequfc
_*35542 4:19 |as a hearing organization because most interpreters , so far , have been hearing people who become| rbwsYIequfc
_*35543 4:28 |professional interpreters and so they created these certifications and it was viewed in| rbwsYIequfc
_*35544 4:40 |that sense of being sort of a hearing person developed certification from the deaf community| rbwsYIequfc
_*35545 4:46 |about our language , our being the deaf community 's language . during that time , i 'm not going| rbwsYIequfc
_*35546 4:54 |to give a specific time , if you want to know , you can do some research , but during that| rbwsYIequfc
_*35547 4:58 |same time period of the csc through the ci/ct certificates which went all the way through| rbwsYIequfc
_*35548 5:03 |to the early turn of the century , by the way . into the 21st century , the national association| rbwsYIequfc
_*35549 5:14 |of the deaf , which can be found at www.nad.org , they wanted to have a certification that was| rbwsYIequfc
_*35550 5:25 |from the deaf community 's point of view , so it was created by deaf people , evaluated by| rbwsYIequfc
_*35551 5:31 |deaf people and therefore , in their view , approved by deaf people , which rid 's at the| rbwsYIequfc
_*35552 5:39 |time was n't necessarily that way . the nad had a certification test and you could get| rbwsYIequfc
_*35553 5:49 |a score between 1 and 5 . 1 and 2 were not yet certified so if somebody took the test| rbwsYIequfc
_*35554 5:57 |and got a 1 , they could not say that they had any level of certification . same thing| rbwsYIequfc
_*35555 6:03 |with the 2 , you could not say that you had any level of certification . if you scored| rbwsYIequfc
_*35556 6:07 |a 3 , nad 's perspective was you were minimally qualified . if you scored a 4 , then they considered| rbwsYIequfc
_*35557 6:18 |you , and by the way , minimally qualified was certified , so a 3 meant you were certified| rbwsYIequfc
_*35558 6:25 |at a minimal level but you were certified , you could meet the minimum standards of a| rbwsYIequfc
_*35559 6:29 |professional . 4 meant you were advanced so it was called the nad advanced and if you| rbwsYIequfc
_*35560 6:36 |got a score of 4 , you were advanced . if you got up to a 5 , then you were called a master ,| rbwsYIequfc
_*35561 6:43 |so nad master . there are people who have all of these certifications i 've listed so if| rbwsYIequfc
_*35562 6:51 |you 're watching this in the early 21st century , meaning probably all the way up to around| rbwsYIequfc
_*35563 6:58 |2040/2050 , if these are still on line , there are people who still have one or any of or| rbwsYIequfc
_*35564 7:07 |all of those certifications , the csc , the ic/tc , the ci/ct and/or any of the nad level| rbwsYIequfc
_*35565 7:19 |3 , 4 or 5 certifications . 3 being certified , 4 being certified advanced , 5 being certified| rbwsYIequfc
_*35566 7:26 |master . well , it came to a point when nad and rid decided that it was time to really| rbwsYIequfc
_*35567 7:34 |come together and create a certification together and not have two separate certifications with| rbwsYIequfc
_*35568 7:40 |different perceptions . they should come together and create a certification that utilized the| rbwsYIequfc
_*35569 7:50 |knowledge of the language and the culture from deaf people 's perspective and the linguistic| rbwsYIequfc
_*35570 7:56 |issues and processing issues and translation issues from one language to another that hearing| rbwsYIequfc
_*35571 8:03 |interpreters can bring to the table . so , they go together and created a certification . they| rbwsYIequfc
_*35572 8:08 |called that ... that committee was called the nci , the national council on interpreting| rbwsYIequfc
_*35573 8:14 |and they called that certificate the nic , so that certification was nic . that certification| rbwsYIequfc
_*35574 8:22 |was set up in a way that the nad was in that you could be nic certified , which means you| rbwsYIequfc
_*35575 8:31 |had a minimum qualification , you could be nic advanced , or you could be nic master .| rbwsYIequfc
_*35576 8:42 |my personal perception of levels is that they 're generally divisive . i 'm not going to test| rbwsYIequfc
_*35577 8:47 |you on personal perceptions , but my personal perception is that they 're generally divisive| rbwsYIequfc
_*35578 8:52 |in nature and so i did n't think it was a great idea but i did n't have anything to do with| rbwsYIequfc
_*35579 8:59 |those committees so i 'm just an outsider looking in on what 's happening . but , i believe that| rbwsYIequfc
_*35580 9:07 |the national council on interpreting or rid and nad together decided the levels really| rbwsYIequfc
_*35581 9:13 |was n't the best way to go so that certification is also no longer available to you as a new| rbwsYIequfc
_*35582 9:21 |person coming in . you can not get an nic advanced , i 'm sorry nic certified , nic advanced or nic| rbwsYIequfc
_*35583 9:28 |master any longer . they 've taken that away . all of these certifications , there will be| rbwsYIequfc
_*35584 9:37 |people that you will meet that will have those certifications and again , these are people| rbwsYIequfc
_*35585 9:43 |that lead you to the profession of interpreting so when you meet them , learn from their experience .| rbwsYIequfc
_*35586 9:52 |now along at that same time of past certifications , during a transition period while nic was coming| rbwsYIequfc
_*35587 10:05 |into play and it was being set up in its early days of testing there was another certification| rbwsYIequfc
_*35588 10:14 |that came out from the nad 's certification and that was called the acci certification| rbwsYIequfc
_*35589 10:22 |- the american consortium of certified interpreters and the acci certification is the exact same| rbwsYIequfc
_*35590 10:34 |certification that nad gave . i 'm not going to go into the politics of how that all happened ,| rbwsYIequfc
_*35591 10:40 |i am quite aware of it but that does n't necessarily need to be sent through the generations , but| rbwsYIequfc
_*35592 10:48 |there was some issue about how the nic was being created and there was a part of the| rbwsYIequfc
_*35593 10:56 |deaf community that wanted to keep the nad certification intact and so they did it but| rbwsYIequfc
_*35594 11:02 |they had to change its name . there was a name change but essentially the group that had| rbwsYIequfc
_*35595 11:08 |been administering the test , the group that had been evaluating the test was the same| rbwsYIequfc
_*35596 11:13 |people , so if somebody has an acci certification they are also considered certified . they are| rbwsYIequfc
_*35597 11:21 |the same as nad so an acci 3 and acci 4 , acci 5 is the same as the nad 3 , 4 and 5 . now ,| rbwsYIequfc
_*35598 11:33 |all of those certifications are gone , they are no longer available to you . what is important| rbwsYIequfc
_*35599 11:43 |related to each of those that are in the past . because they are no longer available , rid| rbwsYIequfc
_*35600 11:49 |wants people , interpreters to be a member of rid in some form and that 's how you can| rbwsYIequfc
_*35601 11:55 |maintain your certification . so , what they did is all of the old certifications , csc ,| rbwsYIequfc
_*35602 12:05 |ic/tc , ci/ct , nic and their levels , you could be a certified member of rid . they took the| rbwsYIequfc
_*35603 12:13 |nad people nad 3 , 4 and 5 and invited them to join rid and be certified members of rid .| rbwsYIequfc
_*35604 12:24 |they also made that same invitation to the people with the acci , so if you have an acci| rbwsYIequfc
_*35605 12:31 |certification , you had an invitation to join rid as a certified member of rid and then| rbwsYIequfc
_*35606 12:39 |you just do the requirements to maintain your certification that rid has established . essentially ,| rbwsYIequfc
_*35607 12:46 |those are past certifications . if you 're a new person checking out the field of interpreting ,| rbwsYIequfc
_*35608 12:53 |those certifications are no longer to you , but there are people who have those certifications .| rbwsYIequfc
_*35609 13:00 |learn from them . they could be your mentors , they could be your teammates . they should| rbwsYIequfc
_*35610 13:05 |be your partners at some point in the form of business related working conditions , when| rbwsYIequfc
_*35611 13:11 |you 're teaming up together so learn from them and appreciate the fact that many of them| rbwsYIequfc
_*35612 13:19 |made it possible for the profession to have the perception of the business world of you| rbwsYIequfc
_*35613 13:28 |being professionals , you being interpreters . alright ? so , that 's a little bit about certifications| rbwsYIequfc
_*35614 13:34 |that are no longer available to you as new people , however , it 's important that you know| rbwsYIequfc
_*35615 13:41 |what they are and that people still have them . alright ? good luck to you !| rbwsYIequfc

_*35755 0:00 |hello asl community ! my name is awti , this is my name sign and you are watching that ! vlog .| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35756 0:15 |hey asl community , i missed you . so this is a weekly vlog where i 'm going to be talking about three things :| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35757 0:22 |1 . what 's up with me , awti . 2 . what 's up with the asl community at large , and last , 3 . i 'm going to offer up| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35758 0:30 |a question to you guys in the community . now you can either type your responses in the comment section below| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35759 0:35 |this video or if you prefer you can film yourself and do a video response . so first , what 's going up with me , awti .| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35760 0:41 |well , over the last several months i 've been traveling to various cities , giving workshops and performances .| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35761 0:46 |as you can see , i 've been to a lot of places , and uhhh ... seems i 've have n't been home very much .| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35762 0:52 |hmmm ... well i want to give a big thank you to everyone involved with the asl community .| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35763 0:58 |i 've had such an amazing time meeting so many asl professionals , both deaf and hearing alike .| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35764 1:02 |it has been great . next week , i 'm actually going to atlanta , ga . i will be at the national association for the| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35765 1:08 |deaf conference and i am thrilled . i will be giving my workshop there and i will be preforming in their| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35766 1:13 |panoramic fireworks bash , with some other really amazing performers so i hope to see ya there .| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35767 1:21 |alright , that 's enough about me . now , let 's talk about what 's going on in the asl community . over the last| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35768 1:27 |four years , i 've been traveling around the country to local asl communities . in my journey , i 've been doing| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35769 1:34 |performances , workshops , lectures . after my performance of `` asl power , '' typically i have people| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35770 1:41 |come up to me , different members of their local asl community , and we have these great discussions .| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35771 1:46 |for example , we will talk about what 's up with the asl community ? what does that really mean ?| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35772 1:51 |we 'll talk about , wow , the incredible power asl has ! we also have discussions about the confrontations| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35773 1:59 |and challenges that the asl community is currently facing and what to do about those . last , how we can| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35774 2:05 |roll up our sleeves and how we can get our there , face those challenges and overcome them . now , in all my| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35775 2:10 |discussions , all this information i 'm collecting from everybody , i 'm not planning on keeping this to myself .| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35776 2:16 |my vision going forward is i 'd really like to make vlogs that get this out to the community at large ,| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35777 2:22 |so i can share it with all of you . so , what 's up with this term `` asl community ? '' what does it really mean ?| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35778 2:29 |well , as you know , we have different groups by which we identify ourselves . the first and most important| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35779 2:35 |group i need to talk about is the deaf . they are really the heart of the asl community . i can tell you that if| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35780 2:44 |you tried to remove the deaf population from the community , it would not thrive . you can not have an| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35781 2:50 |asl community without our deaf members . another group of members we have are the hard-of-hearing .| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35782 2:56 |we also have deaf-blind and , of course , we have codas . which , you know what coda means , right ?| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35783 3:05 |you got it , child of deaf adult . we have another group in our community whose numbers have been growing| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35784 3:15 |exponentially the last thirty or forty years , and that group is called the nerdas .| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35785 3:22 |if you are unfamiliar , it means `` not even related ( to a ) deaf adult . '' lol . over the last ten years , i 've taken a| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35786 3:31 |look at all these different groups that we have among us and i realize there is a better way . we have one| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35787 3:37 |large identity together . that identity is going to be so empowering to us , its going to help us make those| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35788 3:44 |partnerships and those connections and have that sense of pride among us . furthermore , that identity is| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35789 3:51 |going to give us a sense of common purpose so that we can face our challenges together . even more than| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35790 3:53 |that , it 's going to let the world recognize us as one common force that they can support .| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35791 4:03 |we are the asl community . it 's a real thing !| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35792 4:07 |having these little subdivisions between us with all these separate labels| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35793 4:11 |is n't what we 're really about . we 're one community . when i realized that we were one community united ,| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35794 4:19 |it changed my outlook on everything . it changed how i saw myself as well as impacted my identity . i 'll talk| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35795 4:27 |about that more in subsequent vlogs . for now i want to make it very clear that i do not want to remove deaf| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35796 4:33 |identity and i do not want that out of our community . remember when i began this , i said that the deaf| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35797 4:39 |community is the heart of asl community and without them we would cease to exist . my point in all of this is ,| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35798 4:45 |is that i believe that we are at a pivotal time in our community . either things will only get worse or| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35799 4:52 |our community will flourish . i believe that the only way that we are going to develop as a community , is if we| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35800 5:00 |accept our true identity as being members of the asl community . to let you know , if you 're watching this vlog| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35801 5:07 |you 're probably a part of the asl community !| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35802 5:10 |so , that 's whats up in the asl community . now , i 've got a question for you :| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35803 5:15 |why did you - yes , you - decide to be a part of the asl community ? whether you 're hearing or deaf ,| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35804 5:24 |you have made a decision to be a part of the asl community . often , i 'll meet deaf members that will say ,| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35805 5:30 |`` oh , i 'm deaf , of course i 'm in the asl community . '' that 's not always true . you know , we got many people| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35806 5:35 |out in the world that rely on other modes of communication that are not sign language| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35807 5:40 |and they 're not a part of our community . you could just as easily have deviated away from us . so why is it you| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35808 5:46 |decided to be involved in the asl community ? i would love to hear your story and your comments . next week ,| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35809 5:53 |i 'll comment about my answer on that . in subsequent vlogs , i might even include your answer in our videos .| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35810 5:59 |so , if you would , you can type down in the comment section below this video or , if you prefer , you can film| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35811 6:04 |yourself and do a video response in sign language . feel free to send it to me here at| krJkuNq8jnE
_*35812 6:08 |awti.productions @ gmail.com and i look forward to your response . well , that 's all for this week of that ! vlog .| krJkuNq8jnE

_*35829 0:07 |willow yamauchi : that 's me riffing on a harmonica .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35830 0:11 |i used to be a musician . i used to be in a band .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35831 0:15 |that all ended one day onstage at a blues club in vancouver .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35832 0:19 |at the end of the song , i realized i was out of sync| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35833 0:22 |with the rest of the band .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35834 0:25 |it was mortifying .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35835 0:27 |i never played on stage again .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35836 0:30 |i was born half deaf , my right ear does n't work .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35837 0:36 |i 'll never know if my deafness caused| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35838 0:38 |that fatal stumble on stage , but over the years i 've wondered :| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35839 0:41 |was it crazy to think i could be a deaf musician ?| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35840 0:53 |sean forbes : well , i grew up in a musical family ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35841 0:55 |and music was always around us . my parents would often| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35842 0:58 |play all the music that they loved from the 60 's and 70 's ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35843 1:02 |you know , it was not uncommon to hear the rolling stones ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35844 1:05 |or the beatles , or any of those bands in my household .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35845 1:08 |willow yamauchi : sean forbes lives in detroit , michigan .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35846 1:11 |he 's deaf . i sent him a list of questions .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35847 1:14 |sean forbes : so when i was about probably| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35848 1:16 |three or four years old ...| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35849 1:20 |my mom would often play songs in the car| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35850 1:24 |and you know , she would lip sync songs ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35851 1:26 |and music was always around us ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35852 1:28 |but it was n't until my parents realised that ...| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35853 1:31 |[ simple drumming ]| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35854 1:32 |i was following the music and what i was doing| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35855 1:35 |was i was repeating the drum pattern on my thighs .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35856 1:39 |i was drumming along to it on different parts of the car ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35857 1:42 |i 'd be banging on , and i would just , my foot would be going ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35858 1:46 |and when my mom saw that , she was like ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35859 1:47 |`` huh , he 's following the rhythm of the music perfectly , ''| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35860 1:53 |willow yamauchi : so perfectly , his parents got an idea .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35861 1:56 |sean forbes : they decided when i was five years old| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35862 1:58 |to buy me a drum set for christmas .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35863 2:01 |that really opened up a lot of opportunities for me| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35864 2:06 |because it was my parents ' way of saying ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35865 2:08 |you could do whatever it is that you want .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35866 2:11 |willow yamauchi : and what he wanted was pretty simple .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35867 2:12 |sean forbes : from that day forward ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35868 2:14 |all i ever wanted to be was a drummer .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35869 2:21 |willow yamauchi : in another time and another place ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35870 2:24 |a youngster named evelyn glennie| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35871 2:25 |was also just discovering music .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35872 2:28 |evelyn glennie : well , i began losing my hearing| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35873 2:30 |from the age of 8 and that 's when i started piano ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35874 2:32 |but you know , that 's just coincidence ;| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35875 2:35 |i just wanted to start piano , there happened to be a piano| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35876 2:38 |in the house , and i was encouraged to do that| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35877 2:40 |and i enjoyed it , and i then started the clarinet| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35878 2:44 |from the age of 10 .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35879 2:45 |willow yamauchi : over the next two years ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35880 2:47 |she lost about 90 per cent of her hearing ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35881 2:49 |but being profoundly deaf did n't deter her .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35882 2:52 |evelyn glennie : from the age of 12 ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35883 2:53 |i was then introduced to the school orchestra ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35884 2:55 |and i was just so enthralled by that , i really was .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35885 3:01 |and so i looked around the orchestra| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35886 3:04 |and i found percussion and i thought ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35887 3:06 |hmm , maybe i could give that a go .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35888 3:08 |willow yamauchi : one teacher made a huge difference| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35889 3:10 |for young evelyn glennie .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35890 3:12 |evelyn glennie : a very very gifted teacher indeed .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35891 3:15 |and one day he said , `` well heavens , evelyn ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35892 3:17 |`` you know , these drums , they 're extremely resonate ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35893 3:20 |can you actually feel them through any part of your body ? ''| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35894 3:26 |and he struck a tympani , i think it was ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35895 3:28 |and i put my hand to the wall and i said ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35896 3:30 |`` actually , i can feel that , '' from perhaps my fingertip| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35897 3:33 |to part of my palm or something .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35898 3:35 |and then he tuned it to another note and , wow ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35899 3:38 |i could feel it in a different part of my hand .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35900 3:41 |and we went on like that , and that was really| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35901 3:43 |the beginning of discovering that actually my body| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35902 3:48 |really is a huge ear .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35903 3:56 |sean forbes : i always wanted to be a drummer ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35904 3:58 |i always wanted to have long hair ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35905 3:59 |i always wanted to twirl my sticks .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35906 4:01 |and i wanted to be like tommy lee ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35907 4:03 |i wanted to have a drum set that flies across the audience .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35908 4:07 |that , you know , i wanted to be these crazy characters .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35909 4:11 |it was n't until i was in college ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35910 4:15 |i was probably 22 , 23 years old ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35911 4:18 |that i realized that the kind of person that i was| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35912 4:22 |and the kind of musician that i wanted to be ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35913 4:25 |probably was not going to happen for me .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35914 4:28 |willow yamauchi : back in 1982 , evelyn glennie| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35915 4:30 |did an interview with cbc radio , and in that interview ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35916 4:34 |she admitted to some of her own misgivings .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35917 4:36 |evelyn glennie : i know i 've got to prove myself all the time ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35918 4:40 |but i can play . i mean , i 'm not a very good player ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35919 4:43 |but at least i can make an acceptable noise| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35920 4:46 |so that they can appreciate it .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35921 4:54 |all i want to do is just to play all the time .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35922 4:58 |i would actually like to play in an orchestra ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35923 5:03 |but i know problems that would be| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35924 5:05 |playing in a professional orchestra .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35925 5:06 |but doing solo work is great fun ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35926 5:10 |and that 's just what i want to do .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35927 5:31 |willow yamauchi : evelyn glennie had no idea| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35928 5:33 |what kind of successes lay ahead of her : grammies , albums ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35929 5:36 |performing in the 2012 olympic opening ceremonies .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35930 5:40 |and on top of that , a few years ago| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35931 5:42 |she became a dame commander of the british empire !| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35932 5:46 |but i still do n't get it .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35933 5:48 |how does a deaf musician do it ?| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35934 5:57 |[ radio static ]| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35935 6:05 |sean forbes : when i listen to the radio , for instance ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35936 6:08 |the only things that i really pick up| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35937 6:10 |are the drums and the bass .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35938 6:13 |everything else is , you know , kind of disappears for me .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35939 6:18 |i can hear the vocal , depending on where| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35940 6:20 |the vocal is placed in the mix . often for my own mixes ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35941 6:23 |we place the vocals out in front , so that i can hear them .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35942 6:27 |and so the majority of my audience , which are deaf people ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35943 6:32 |can experience my music as well .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35944 6:34 |evelyn glennie : i feel , for example ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35945 6:36 |if we imagine high sounds , a lot of them are felt| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35946 6:39 |in the upper parts of the body . so the scalp , your cheekbones ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35947 6:43 |even your teeth actually . your neck , your breasts , and so on .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35948 6:48 |a lot of the low sounds are felt in the lower parts of your body .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35949 6:53 |even beethoven , when he lost his hearing ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35950 6:55 |he still had that instinct to go to his keyboard ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35951 6:59 |to put his mouth against the keyboard itself| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35952 7:02 |in order to feel these things .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35953 7:14 |he found another way to try to perceive sound .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35954 7:18 |willow yamauchi : it 's widely believed that beethoven| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35955 7:21 |wrote his 9th symphony while profoundly deaf .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35956 7:33 |that was the time when people assumed that deafness| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35957 7:36 |meant that , well , you just simply could n't hear .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35958 7:38 |but he was showing the signs that , `` well , hold on a second ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35959 7:41 |i am actually feeling something , you know , i really am . ''| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35960 7:50 |willow yamauchi : but let 's face it ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35961 7:51 |there 's only one beethoven .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35962 7:53 |sean 's parents wanted him to be practical .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35963 7:55 |sean forbes : i got an opportunity to be an intern| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35964 7:57 |at an electric company in chicago .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35965 8:00 |and at the end of the summer , my boss took me aside| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35966 8:03 |and he said , `` sean , you were amazing this summer .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35967 8:07 |`` you were so amazing that we want to pay| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35968 8:10 |`` for your college education . we want to have a job for you| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35969 8:15 |`` when you complete college , and you 'll be making| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35970 8:17 |80 thousand dollars a year right when you graduate . ''| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35971 8:20 |most people would have been like ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35972 8:22 |`` oh yeah , i 'm going to take this opportunity , yes . ''| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35973 8:24 |me on the other hand , i was like ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35974 8:26 |`` thank you , but no , i want to be a musician . ''| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35975 8:29 |they were just like , their jaws were on the floor .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35976 8:31 |they were like , `` what ? no , we are offering you| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35977 8:34 |`` the opportunity of a lifetime , and you 're telling us| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35978 8:38 |that you want to become a musician ? are you crazy ? ''| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35979 8:41 |willow yamauchi : at this point , sean was 22 or 23 years old .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35980 8:45 |he 'd met lots of people in the detroit music scene ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35981 8:47 |but he had n't met anyone with what he likes to call ...| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35982 8:49 |sean forbes : a deaf connection .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35983 8:51 |willow yamauchi : until he met ...| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35984 8:52 |sean forbes : joel martin , he was a music publisher| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35985 8:56 |and he happened to own the recording studio| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35986 9:00 |that eminem worked at .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35987 9:02 |he told me that he had a deaf brother-in-law .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35988 9:04 |willow yamauchi : sean made a video of himself performing| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35989 9:06 |eminem 's song , `` lose yourself , '' in american sign language .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35990 9:09 |he asked for a meeting , and joel obliged .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35991 9:12 |sean forbes : everybody was there , eminem was there ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35992 9:14 |his producers were there , his engineers were there .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35993 9:17 |i had already met them before but this was the first time| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35994 9:20 |that they had really seen what i was capable of ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35995 9:24 |translating eminem 's songs into sign language .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35996 9:27 |so at this point , they decided to hire me| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35997 9:29 |for an internship .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35998 9:31 |willow yamauchi : sean saw opportunities everywhere .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*35999 9:34 |sean forbes : just by chance one day ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36000 9:35 |i was in the lounge and i found this cd sitting on the table| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36001 9:40 |that said `` beats '' on it , and i decided to steal it .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36002 9:44 |not something that you should do in the eminem office| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36003 9:48 |because they are very strict about that ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36004 9:50 |but i just saw it there , it was like shining at me .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36005 9:54 |and it was like , `` take me sean , take me ! ''| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36006 9:56 |so i took the cd , put it in my coat ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36007 10:00 |walked out the back door with it ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36008 10:02 |got into my car , put it in the cd player ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36009 10:05 |and i was like , `` oh , my gosh ! ''| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36010 10:11 |these beats were just speaking to me ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36011 10:14 |and i started writing lyrics to them ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36012 10:17 |to the point where i have these songs and these lyrics .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36013 10:20 |i did n't know who they were ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36014 10:22 |i did n't know if they were eminem 's producers ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36015 10:24 |or if they were eminem himself ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36016 10:26 |or if they were , i did n't know who they belonged to .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36017 10:29 |willow yamauchi : sean had to fess up .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36018 10:31 |sean forbes : you know , i finally confessed that i stole these .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36019 10:33 |you know , they knew i was crazy at that point ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36020 10:36 |but crazy enough to not go out there| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36021 10:38 |and like send these songs out to somebody else .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36022 10:41 |and i shared these songs with them , and they were like ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36023 10:44 |`` what ? you 're writing songs , you 're writing lyrics ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36024 10:48 |like , what is this ? ''| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36025 10:49 |willow yamauchi : what it was , was the beginning| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36026 10:51 |of an unique musical partnership .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36027 10:53 |sean forbes : those beats belonged to a 16-year-old kid ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36028 10:56 |actually he was 15 at the time , and they introduced me to him .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36029 11:02 |and from that moment forward ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36030 11:03 |we started writing songs together .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36031 11:05 |so that was really the start of it all , you know ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36032 11:07 |this 15 year old kid took a chance on me| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36033 11:10 |and all of a sudden i 'm writing songs with him .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36034 11:50 |[ sean laughs ]| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36035 12:01 |willow yamauchi : evelyn glennie did n't lift beats from anyone ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36036 12:04 |but she did have to fight for acceptance| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36037 12:06 |from the music establishment .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36038 12:12 |evelyn glennie : i auditioned for two places in london ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36039 12:15 |not expecting to get in because i was quite young .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36040 12:18 |willow yamauchi : being deaf was n't her worry ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36041 12:20 |but when she turned up at the royal academy of music ...| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36042 12:22 |evelyn glennie : they actually did n't let me in| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36043 12:24 |because of my hearing , and i challenged that .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36044 12:28 |i said , `` look , are you saying i am not getting in| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36045 12:30 |`` because of my hearing , or because of my ability ?| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36046 12:32 |`` if it 's because of my ability , i will completely accept that| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36047 12:36 |`` and respect that . however , if it 's because of my hearing ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36048 12:38 |i absolutely will not accept that . ''| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36049 12:47 |willow yamauchi : there was one dissenting voice on the panel .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36050 12:50 |that panellist said :| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36051 12:51 |evelyn glennie : we need to let her in .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36052 12:53 |willow yamauchi : so , they gave her another chance .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36053 12:55 |evelyn glennie : they were used to blind musicians actually ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36054 12:58 |because that , you know , we 've seen a lot of jazz musicians| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36055 13:00 |for example , we 've seen a lot of sight impaired pianists ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36056 13:03 |classical pianists and so on .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36057 13:05 |but suddenly a hearing impaired musician ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36058 13:07 |this was totally alien to them .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36059 13:14 |they asked me to return , and they gave me| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36060 13:17 |a totally unprepared audition , and after that they said ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36061 13:21 |`` okay , you can start in september , ''| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36062 13:27 |we each have to find our own sound world .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36063 13:37 |you know , for any young musician who is hearing impaired ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36064 13:41 |just be aware that you are the musician| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36065 13:44 |who happens to be deaf .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36066 13:48 |sean forbes : if you want to be a musician ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36067 13:49 |you want to be a basketball player ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36068 13:51 |you want to do all these things , be prepared to work| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36069 13:54 |twice as hard for it . the truth is ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36070 13:57 |i 've had to work twice as hard because i 'm deaf ,| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36071 14:00 |because of my speech , because of all these different things| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36072 14:03 |that i 'm unable to do i 've had to work twice as hard| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36073 14:05 |to get to where i am today .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36074 14:10 |sean forbes : and that 's that .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36075 14:34 |willow yamauchi : as for me , i 'm picking up my harmonica again .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36076 14:37 |it turns out you can be deaf and be a musician after all .| Svi1noSu8dI
_*36077 0:04 |hi everybody welcome back ! so today| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36078 0:08 |i have jenna here ! woohoo ! i know| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36079 0:12 |you love having jenna in the videos more than just when i 'm here . admit it !| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36080 0:16 |they love you . jenna : eh| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36081 0:20 |scary . jill : well i love you ! so| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36082 0:25 |anyways today i wanted to dicuss closed captioning| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36083 0:29 |your videos . jenn : cc ! jill : yeah| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36084 0:33 |cc so the reason i wanted to discuss| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36085 0:37 |that is i 'm not sure if you 're aware of it . they have something called glide .| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36086 0:41 |what 's the sign for that . jenna : there are a lot of different signs but probably this .| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36087 0:45 |jill : ok glide . so you know on your cellphone ,| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36088 0:50 |they have an app . it 's like video texting .| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36089 0:54 |you know you can send videos back and forth . which is nice for deaf people because| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36090 0:58 |sign are better than texting workds . jenna : because we 're visual !| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36091 1:02 |jill : right because they 're visual and plus also , it 's just horrible . you know sometimes you 're texting| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36092 1:06 |and you do n't see the person 's emotions . like sometimes i 'll look at her text and think| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36093 1:10 |she 's mad and she 's not at all . it 's just misunderstandings .| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36094 1:15 |jenna : i 'm very blunt . jill : yeah that 's true ! the reason i mentioned| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36095 1:19 |that is because the people that make that app glide ,| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36096 1:23 |realized that there 's many deaf people using| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36097 1:27 |that a lot . so they 've kinda becomed more focused ... i think the woman 's name is| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36098 1:31 |sarah . she does n't know any sign but now she 's learning sign langauge .| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36099 1:35 |she puts up little messages about that . so recently| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36100 1:39 |uh glide and a few different other youtube people who do sign ,| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36101 1:44 |uh they set up a campaign i guess talking about closed| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36102 1:48 |captioning videos . so i 'm gon na let jenna kind of explain the reason why you should| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36103 1:52 |closed caption your videos . jenna : closed captioning your videos| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36104 1:56 |is not only good for deaf who are n't able to hear . they ca n't understand| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36105 2:00 |speech . that 's why they watch the captions . also there 's other people| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36106 2:04 |like someone who speaks another language . they like to learn english . so they 're able to| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36107 2:08 |listen and then read the captions . some people just simply like to| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36108 2:12 |maybe they ca n't have sound at work or something like that .| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36109 2:17 |so they like something else . so it 's kinda nice to have that| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36110 2:21 |you know for youtube because they have like auto| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36111 2:25 |captions which are horrible ! jill : yeah horrible| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36112 2:29 |jenna : they make no sense whatsoever . yeah they are lousy . so i 'm like umm| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36113 2:33 |ok whatever , but they 're just not good . so ,| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36114 2:37 |it 's best to put captions on there just to make sure it 's more accurate , you know what you want to| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36115 2:42 |say and matching up . that way everyone has access . you know| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36116 2:46 |everyone 's able to watch and read . jill : yeah like| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36117 2:50 |you know a lot of times i 'll watch ... i watch a lot of youtube . i do n't really watch tv| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36118 2:54 |that much but i watch youtube . hello ! cat ! anyways ,| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36119 2:58 |so you know a lot of people i tend to watch , they do n't have| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36120 3:02 |closed caption . so sometimes i feel like she is not able to join in with me . i want to show| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36121 3:07 |her something . i 'll interpret for your , but sometimes you know watching the interpreting , you| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36122 3:11 |miss out a lot and you do n't get to see the funny stuff on there . so , i do n't know| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36123 3:15 |i just prefer to have closed captions . i notice now they have like| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36124 3:19 |some kind of feature on youtube where people can i guess| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36125 3:23 |donate their time captioning other people 's videos . so ,| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36126 3:28 |a lot of popular people now are able to caption their videos . which is so important because| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36127 3:32 |so many thing on youtube . so many great things for deaf people , or really anyone| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36128 3:36 |that are able to watch . i mean sometimes i 'll watch then at work| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36129 3:40 |and i can have noise on there , but i do n't like to bother other people . you know cause| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36130 3:44 |of their interpreting process . you know their thinking process . so| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36131 3:48 |i prefer to have it on mute and then watch it with the captoins but a lot fo them do n't have| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36132 3:53 |captions . so that 's the reason i like to caption . that 's why i caption all my videos here now .| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36133 3:57 |on my other channel , my beauty , uh cooking , whatever| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36134 4:01 |and closed caption all my videos there . so i really want to encourage everyone| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36135 4:05 |to please please , if you make videos yourself ,| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36136 4:09 |to go ahead and closed caption your videos . it 's really simple . youtube has a| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36137 4:13 |feature on there you can type on . it 's really simple . umm| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36138 4:18 |also for deaf people , if you make videos it 's probably be a good idea| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36139 4:22 |for you to caption your videos too for hearing people . you know kind of thinking the opposite .| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36140 4:26 |because a lot of hearing people are interested in those videos , but if you 're just signing| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36141 4:30 |then you know they would miss out . so you know , you do n't| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36142 4:34 |have captions . jenna : you know it 's important to be accessible for all .| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36143 4:38 |jill : right , right and also , you watch| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36144 4:42 |a lot of people on youtube or someone you really like , a favorite . leave them a comment ,| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36145 4:47 |on their videos and say you ... or direct message them and say| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36146 4:51 |closed caption your videos . you know really it 's helpful for| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36147 4:55 |everyone . you know , they 'll get more subscribers . more views on their videos . so| m-6tXtRF9Us
_*36148 4:59 |please encourage everyone to closed caption your videos . that is the| m-6tXtRF9Us

_*36224 4:06 |in the state where you live some states do have a licensure ma| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36225 4:10 |away read that you have to have this certification in order to work| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36226 4:15 |there other states i do n't have it but| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36227 4:18 |i you they still require some sort of certification to it| 3BTZ4U5MUKU

_*36231 4:34 |a grow but you can also specialize in certain areas| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36232 4:38 |there 's theatrical interpreting which would be in| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36233 4:41 |theater music festivals there is mental health interpreting| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36234 4:46 |which has to do with mental how her and then they 're| 3BTZ4U5MUKU

_*36236 4:54 |that specialize certification| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36237 4:57 |the skills needed for this job are really varied i think that 's one of the| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36238 5:01 reasons 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36239 5:02 |that our national organization or acquired a four year degree| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36240 5:07 |you really do have to have a strong english base| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36241 5:10 |i and not on british-led but i 'm talking about . english is far as speaking| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36242 5:15 |english in understanding english| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36243 5:17 |having a bride a scopus experiences| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36244 5:21 |also helps you when you go into the different settings whether it be| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36245 5:26 |from medical into business had a little taste the something and know what| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36246 5:30 |they 're talking about| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36247 5:31 |the whole lot easier to interpret i| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36248 5:35 |good to have people skills cuz you 're working with people all the time| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36249 5:38 |which is one of the reasons i love it i love talking to people so here i am| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36250 5:43 i 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36251 5:48 |on the best and worst parts at this job| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36252 5:51 |% uh the best parts and i get to meet all kinds of interesting people| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36253 5:56 |loved learning different things i have from| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36254 6:00 |i was interpreting in a carpentry class i can tell you how to build a house| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36255 6:04 |from the ground up i being at the| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36256 6:08 |birth of a baby may be interpreted parents then| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36257 6:12 |% uh celebrations and really great parts a people 's jobs that if they 've gotten a| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36258 6:18 promotion 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36259 6:20 |i which also can kinda bring me to the worst part| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36260 6:23 |being at the deathbed in having to interpret for someone someone is saying| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36261 6:28 |goodbye to a loved one| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36262 6:30 |a or anything in that kinda thing| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36263 6:34 |or having to tell somebody they 're fired when you know that they have four kids| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36264 6:38 |at home that they have to eat| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36265 6:40 |atrophied and you and in| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36266 6:45 |those are the tough times i you think the only other best to worst kind of| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36267 6:50 |thing is| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36268 6:51 |as i said before meeting people belong to the worst the paperwork| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36269 6:56 |there is some paperwork involved i 'd i love to say that there is n't| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36270 7:00 |bad if you wan na get paid you have to do some paperwork| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36271 7:07 |my final advice to anybody who| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36272 7:09 |wan na become an interpreter is most a ball| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36273 7:13 |find the deaf community in your area it| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36274 7:16 |just you contact the local agency who might work with that people| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36275 7:20 |and find out where they would go a lot of times there 's def clubs| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36276 7:25 |and interact with them the best interpreters usually| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36277 7:29 |come from people who love add been around the deaf community and learn from| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36278 7:33 them 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36279 7:34 |you can just you need to learn the culture and their environment and how| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36280 7:39 |they 'd| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36281 7:40 |communicate with each other and you know it it 's that| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36282 7:44 |the best way to really learn the language it also britt builds trust| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36283 7:49 |between the deaf community and yourself| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36284 7:51 |that is critical in being an interpreter| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36285 7:54 |as i said before the different kinds of settings you would be from the doctor 's| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36286 7:58 |office to a business meeting to| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36287 8:00 |wherever workplace you are being put in| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36288 8:04 |their situations where normally here with hearing people you would not be| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36289 8:09 there 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36290 8:09 |so you need to have that trust that they know| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36291 8:13 |the you 're going to voice exactly what they sign| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36292 8:16 |and that when someone speaking you 're going to render that message| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36293 8:20 |faithfully back to them so many situations are very personal| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36294 8:25 |so the deaf community wants to know that you 're gon na have| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36295 8:29 |confidentiality about what goes on in| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36296 8:32 |in those situations they have to trust and know that you are not going to| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36297 8:37 |go out and saying anything to anybody else i love that is probably the key to| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36298 8:42 |be necessary successful the interpreter| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36299 8:45 |is having the deaf community trust you| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36300 8:48 |to carry their messages into the world and to have| 3BTZ4U5MUKU
_*36301 8:52 |the trust that their message will be carried into the world from you| 3BTZ4U5MUKU

_*37033 0:01 |surely this will be the last opportunity for me to address you .| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37034 0:07 |the air force has bombed the towers of radio portales and radio corporacion .| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37035 0:17 |my words do not have bitterness but disappointment .| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37036 0:26 |may they be a moral punishment for those who have betrayed their oath .| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37037 0:33 |soldiers of chile , titular commanders in chief , admiral merino| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37038 0:46 |who has designated himself commander of the navy , and mr. mendoza , the despicable general| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37039 0:52 |who only yesterday pledged his fidelity and loyalty to the government , and who also has| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37040 0:59 |appointed himself chief of the carabineros [ national police ] .| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37041 1:03 |given these facts , the only thing left for me is to say to workers :| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37042 1:08 |i am not going to resign .| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37043 1:14 |placed in a historic transition , i will pay the people 's loyalty with my life .| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37044 1:23 |and i say to you that i 'm certain that the seed we have sown in the dignified conscience| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37045 1:33 |of thousands and thousands of chileans will not be shrivelled forever| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37046 1:41 |they have the strength , they may overcome us , but social processes can not be stopped| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37047 1:50 |neither by crime or by force . history is ours , and it 's made by the people .| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37048 2:04 |workers of my country : i want to thank you for the loyalty that you always had , the confidence| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37049 2:12 |that you deposited in a man who was only an interpreter of great yearnings for justice ,| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37050 2:24 |who gave his word that he would respect the constitution and the law and did just that .| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37051 2:30 |at this definitive moment , the last moment i can address you , i wish you to take| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37052 2:40 |advantage of the lesson : foreign capital , imperialism , together with the reaction , created| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37053 2:49 |the climate in which the armed forces broke their tradition , the tradition taught by general| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37054 3:00 |schneider and reaffirmed by commander araya . victims of the same social sector which will| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37055 3:08 |today be in their homes hoping , with foreign assistance , to retake power to continue defending| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37056 3:17 |their profits and their privileges .| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37057 3:23 |i address , above all , the modest woman of our land , the peasant farmer who believed in us ,| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37058 3:32 |the worker who worked harder , the mother who knew our concern for children . i address professionals| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37059 3:41 |of our country , patriotic professionals , those who a few days ago continued working against the sedition| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37060 3:53 |sponsored by professional associations , class-based associations that also defended the advantages| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37061 3:59 |which a capitalist society grants to a few .| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37062 4:04 |i address the youth , those who sang and gave us their joy and their spirit of struggle .| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37063 4:12 |i address the man of chile , the worker , the farmer , the intellectual , those who will be| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37064 4:20 |persecuted , because in our country fascism has been already present for many hours :| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37065 4:29 |in terrorist attacks , blowing up the bridges , cutting the railroad tracks , destroying the| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37066 4:35 |oil and gas pipelines , in the face of the silence of those who had the obligation to| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37067 4:41 |protect them . they were committed . history will judge them .| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37068 4:47 |surely radio magallanes will be silenced , and the calm metal of my voice| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37069 4:54 |will no longer reach you . it does not matter . you will continue hearing it . i will always| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37070 4:59 |be next to you . at least my memory will be that of a man of dignity who was loyal to| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37071 5:06 |the loyalty of the workers .| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37072 5:10 |the people must defend themselves , but they must not sacrifice themselves . the people| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37073 5:14 |must not let themselves be destroyed or riddled with bullets , but they can not be humiliated either .| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37074 5:20 |workers of my country , i have faith in chile and its destiny . other men will overcome this| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37075 5:29 |grey and bitter moment when treason seeks to prevail . go forward knowing that , sooner| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37076 5:39 |rather than later , the great avenues will open again , where free men will walk to build| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37077 5:48 |a better society .| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37078 5:51 |long live chile ! long live the people ! long live the workers !| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37079 5:56 |these have been my last words , and i am certain that my sacrifice will not be in vain .| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37080 6:04 |i am certain that , at the very least , it will be a moral lesson that will punish felony , cowardice ,| HC8UirZLCZQ
_*37081 6:13 |and treason .| HC8UirZLCZQ

_*37090 0:06 |in america , hearing children enter kindergarten ready to learn because they have a strong first language .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37091 0:12 |at home , their parents predominantly use spoken language to communicate , which is accessible for them| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37092 0:16 |to acquire language .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37093 0:17 |after acquiring language , they can develop their basic interpersonal communication skills ( bics ) ,| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37094 0:23 |within 6 months to 2 years , which is important to play , interact , and socialize with other children and adults .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37095 0:33 |with a strong bics foundation , the child can enter school ready to learn and acquire academic skills such| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37096 0:39 |as literacy and math , also called cognitive academic language proficiency ( calp ) ,| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37097 0:46 |requiring 5 to 7 years to develop .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37098 0:50 |deaf children with hearing parents do not have the same access to spoken language used by their parents at| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37099 0:54 |home and have not fully acquired language , developed their bics , nor do they enter school ready to learn .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37100 1:04 |the children start school at a disadvantage because they need to learn both bics and calp simultaneously .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37101 1:08 |research in 1995 shows that children without a strong first language require 7 to 10 years to catch up with| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37102 1:19 |where they need to be .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37103 1:21 |nationally , deaf children on average have a 4th grade reading level , which is a challenging issue to address .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37104 1:30 |however , research shows that deaf children of deaf parents acquire language and enter school ready to| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37105 1:38 |learn because their parents use an accessible , visual language in the home , which provides them with the| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37106 1:44 |needed to develop their bics and succeed academically .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37107 1:49 |research shows that deaf children of deaf parents have similar academic achievement as hearing children .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37108 1:58 |many research shown here have found a strong relationship between asl proficiency and english| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37109 2:05 |literacy skills .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37110 2:10 |in 2011 , a group of researchers recruited 55 deaf participants from washington , d.c. , who were mostly| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37111 2:15 |gallaudet university , and tested their asl proficiency and english literacy skills .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37112 2:24 |they found a strong positive relationship between asl proficiency and english literacy skills .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37113 2:31 |many researchers will use strategies that are successful for teaching literacy to hearing children with deaf| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37114 2:39 |children who are struggling to develop their literacy skills when they should instead be replicating the conditions in| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37115 2:44 |which deaf children of deaf parents successfully develop their literacy .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37116 2:52 |research shows that deaf children of hearing parents can successfully acquire language and develop literacy| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37117 2:58 |if they are exposed to deaf adult signers and taught using asl and english bilingual approaches .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37118 3:10 |also , in 2013 , a group of researchers interviewed 12 teachers and parents who have deaf children with| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37119 3:18 |skills to identify the following conditions required to replicate their success .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37120 3:24 |deaf children need to be exposed to a visual , accessible language such as asl to acquire language .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37121 3:32 |asl as a strong first language can serve as a bridge for learning english literacy skills .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37122 3:39 |fingerspelling should be used with children , regardless if they are very young , to encourage them to acquire the| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37123 3:44 |skills early and can be a tool to teach them literacy .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37124 3:49 |in the home , a print culture should be created using books and pictures with text to introduce children to| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37125 3:55 |literacy . also , parents should read with their children often , regardless of what they are reading , so they| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37126 4:01 |can instill desire in their children to become literate .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37127 4:09 |schools and teachers are encouraged to respect asl and english equally by providing k-12 asl instruction in| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37128 4:18 |addition to existing english instruction .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37129 4:25 |also , they should challenge students with reading that is above their reading level so they will strive to develop| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37130 4:30 |higher literacy skills .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37131 4:33 |in addition , they are encouraged to teach asl and english strategies for children to self-correct their errors .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37132 4:43 |with the knowledge that asl proficiency is critical for deaf children to develop their english literacy skills ,| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37133 4:48 |support and services need to be provided to parents as early as possible .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37134 4:53 |many advocates promote requiring an asl language specialist at every ifsp and iep meeting so they can| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37135 5:07 |should be assessed and compared to benchmarks to ensure they develop their bics and enter school ready| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37136 5:13 |to learn .| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37137 5:16 |after deaf children start school , their achievement should continue to be assessed and tracked to ensure| AVhrwJUSu4E
_*37138 5:20 |they thrive academically .| AVhrwJUSu4E

_*37519 0:01 |hi , everyone . again .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37520 0:06 |now , in this vlog , i 'm going to explain why we need more deaf scientists .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37521 0:19 |this topic is particularly relevant to me , as i 'm working toward becoming a scientist .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37522 0:47 |there are three reasons why we need more deaf scientists :| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37523 0:54 |the first is representation of interest ( i 'll explain later ) ,| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37524 1:01 |the second one is communication ,| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37525 1:05 |the third one is something i like to call `` facilitation . ''| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37526 1:14 |facilitation is basically making a process easier .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37527 1:22 |now , representation of interest is pretty obvious .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37528 1:30 |it means that for any minority group , such as the deaf community , or any group that 's underrepresented in a field ( like women in engineering ) ,| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37529 1:51 |there is a need for equal representation of interest that is missing .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37530 2:03 |underrepresentation exists in fields like engineering , obviously , as well as for women in politics and the united states congress ...| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37531 2:15 |and also people of color in congress ...| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37532 2:21 |and many more examples .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37533 2:26 |relating to deaf people , representation of interest is really really important .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37534 2:37 |if there were more deaf scientists , there can be more of a focus on deaf-related issues and a spread of ideas .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37535 2:53 |and deaf scientists could spread knowledge of deaf issues to hearing scientists .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37536 2:59 |and another reason we need representation of interest| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37537 3:05 |is for public relations and sensitivity to deaf culture and deafness-related issues .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37538 3:19 |we know that hearing people tend to call d/deaf and hard of hearing people `` hearing impaired , '' which is a term that is frowned upon in the deaf community .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37539 3:54 |so basically why we need representation of interest is that any deaf-related issue gets more awareness .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37540 4:10 |alright , moving on to # 2 : communication .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37541 4:14 |this one should be obvious .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37542 4:19 |communication in science is important .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37543 4:31 |scientists need to know how to communicate effectively .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37544 4:42 |the more scientists who know asl , the better , and it should be encouraged .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37545 4:54 |everyone benefits from it , both hearing and deaf scientists .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37546 5:05 |and deaf scientists can easily socialize , network and collaborate .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37547 5:27 |synergy is an awesome thing ; 3| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37548 5:32 |again , this should be obvious .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37549 5:35 |alright , now to # 3 : facilitation .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37550 5:41 |now , you may be wondering what `` facilitation '' would mean in this context .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37551 5:47 |well , i 'll explain ...| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37552 5:52 |well , first off , i know lots of people notice that for a lot of scientific terms , there are no asl equivalents .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37553 6:11 |in a science class , how would an interpreter sign new terms ? ?| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37554 6:19 |the interpreter might make up a sign or describe the concept , which takes a while .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37555 6:28 |this is n't the most effective way .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37556 6:34 |so , deaf scientists who know the concept behind some ... science ... thing ...| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37557 6:45 |can think about how they would sign it , prompting a discussion amongst other deaf scientists .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37558 6:59 |so , in the process of creating a new sign , it encourages discussion , too ! which also benefits everyone .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37559 7:09 |so , if you can create a sign and let it spread so everyone knows it ...| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37560 7:25 |then , teachers of the deaf can use that sign and they do n't have to spell it letter by letter .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37561 7:33 |makes learning science for deaf children easier and more effective .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37562 7:41 |if more deaf students learned science easily , thanks to the new signs ,| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37563 7:52 |then maybe , they could eventually become deaf science teachers themselves .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37564 7:59 |and that would encourage a new generation of deaf scientists .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37565 8:05 |that 's my vision for the future , my dream .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37566 8:09 |and if there are more deaf science teachers , it would greatly improve deaf education .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37567 8:24 |you agree , right ? ; p| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37568 8:28 |it just really inspires me .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37569 8:34 |i think that when i retire from scientific research , i 'd wan na become a teacher myself .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37570 8:42 |i 'd like to teach deaf children science .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37571 8:49 |the first step is creating new signs for scientific terms for making learning science easier .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37572 9:03 |and that requires ... deaf scientists !| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37573 9:09 |i know it 's a cycle and it has to start somewhere ...| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37574 9:14 |but , it 's slowly improving .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37575 9:19 |it 's happening now .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37576 9:23 |hopefully , this trend will continue into the future .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37577 9:29 |okay , that 's it for- well , i 'll summarize .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37578 9:38 |why do we need more deaf scientists ?| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37579 9:42 |representation of interest .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37580 9:44 |communication .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37581 9:47 |facilitation .| 6GnSzk_WHWo
_*37582 9:51 |yup . ok , thanks for watching !| 6GnSzk_WHWo

_*38123 0:00 |hi . my name is scott lewis . ( showing the name sign )| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38124 0:06 |i am deaf and gay .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38125 0:10 |i am the only deaf person in my family , who are all hearing .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38126 0:15 |i went to a mainstreamed school .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38127 0:20 |i was not bullied .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38128 0:23 |but i did encounter indirect bullying , perhaps unintentional .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38129 0:32 |my family and friends made gay jokes , which were negative stereotypical jokes .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38130 0:41 |it made me realize that they did n't think highly of gay people in general .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38131 0:48 |i decided to not say anything and stayed in the closet .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38132 0:55 |in high school i had a few girlfriends .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38133 1:00 |i was trying to conform to society 's expectations of what a person should be .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38134 1:09 |i really tried my best , but the result was that i was not happy .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38135 1:15 |i had to put on a mask to make people think i was happy , but i was mentally , emotionally , and spiritually heartbroken and got depressed .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38136 1:30 |i did consider suicide . yes i did !| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38137 1:38 |and i came close to doing it several times .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38138 1:42 |did i ask my family and friends for help ? i never did .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38139 1:49 |i chose to rely on myself for help .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38140 1:55 |i always thought `` what if tomorrow gets better ? will things get better ? ''| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38141 2:04 |so i decided to stick it out and see what happens .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38142 2:10 |finally , i made it out of my inner darkness .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38143 2:21 |i accidentally came out to one of my good friends , mary k rogers .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38144 2:32 |i was using her computer , and i accidentally typed in my password in the username line , and it happened to have a gay term in it .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38145 2:47 |she happened to see the password and asked me `` are you gay ? ''| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38146 2:51 |i was nervous , but i decided to tell her the truth and admitted `` yes , i 'm gay ''| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38147 2:59 |she was like `` oh ! that 's fine ! it 's all right ! ''| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38148 3:04 |that instantly made me feel better .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38149 3:10 |so ... that made me want to try to come out to my family .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38150 3:19 |i did come out to my family .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38151 3:24 |and my mother did not take it well at first . she said it was ok , but i could tell that she was not pleased about it . it took her quite a while to accept who i am .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38152 3:44 |i did not come out completely until i went to gallaudet university in washington dc in 2000 .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38153 3:51 |i met so many glbt people .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38154 4:00 |meeting them made me realize that it is perfectly fine to be a gay person .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38155 4:10 |hmm hmm !| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38156 4:12 |so.. it does get better ! there 's definitely an improvement !| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38157 4:21 |why ? let me tell you .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38158 4:23 |i met my boyfriend of 10 years there . whoa ! wow ! 10 years already ? ! that 's a big deal to me !| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38159 4:43 |so ! if you feel alone and there 's no support .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38160 4:57 |just wait ! middle school , high school , and for some - college - are only a drop of water in a bucket !| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38161 5:09 |shrug your bullys off and hang in there til you meet your future gay friends| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38162 5:20 |your family may not be so accepting at first , but give them time and they will eventually come around to accept who you are .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38163 5:32 |things will get better ! just have faith and believe in yourself ! that 's all you need .| YbNSlfJsEI0
_*38164 5:45 |bullied or not bullied , things will get better ! take care of yourself !| YbNSlfJsEI0

_*38172 2:47 |as you can see he enters the elevator and then presses the button to go down .| VTpkdtzncT0

_*39285 0:00 |you have now seen both of these symbols .| v6tXw9uPtbU
_*39286 0:04 |remember that these dots mean the bending occur ...| v6tXw9uPtbU
_*39287 0:08 |... at the middle part of the finger . like this .| v6tXw9uPtbU
_*39288 0:14 |the symbols on the right , here , mean the bending is at the base of the finger .| v6tXw9uPtbU
_*39289 0:19 |so if i had , with this top left symbol , a five-hand ...| v6tXw9uPtbU
_*39290 0:24 |... the fingers would close into a fist one finger at a time .| v6tXw9uPtbU
_*39291 0:28 |like this .| v6tXw9uPtbU
_*39292 0:30 |with this bottom left symbol here ...| v6tXw9uPtbU
_*39293 0:33 |the fist would open one finger at a time into a five-hand .| v6tXw9uPtbU
_*39294 0:39 |now , with this top right symbol here ...| v6tXw9uPtbU
_*39295 0:42 |... the same five-hand would close into an angled handshape ...| v6tXw9uPtbU
_*39296 0:45 |... one finger at a time because the bending occurs ...| v6tXw9uPtbU
_*39297 0:48 |... with the knuckles at the base of the fingers .| v6tXw9uPtbU
_*39298 0:51 |not at the middle knuckles of the fingers ...| v6tXw9uPtbU
_*39299 0:55 |... because that would be the symbol on the right .| v6tXw9uPtbU
_*39300 0:57 |so this bends at the base .| v6tXw9uPtbU
_*39301 1:00 |this bottom right symbol would open ...| v6tXw9uPtbU
_*39302 1:03 |... from the angled handshape into a five-hand .| v6tXw9uPtbU
_*39303 1:06 |the symbol on the right would start with ...| v6tXw9uPtbU
_*39304 1:09 |... a fist rather than the angled handshape .| v6tXw9uPtbU
_*39305 0:05 |it feels good to be back .| Lgmx8CoiES8
_*39306 0:07 |[ sigh of relief ]| Lgmx8CoiES8

_*39309 0:12 |the vlog series on sex education .| Lgmx8CoiES8
_*39310 0:15 |it 's been a long and busy year| Lgmx8CoiES8
_*39311 0:20 |i realized that i want to return to| Lgmx8CoiES8

_*39314 0:30 |what do you mean , a new format ?| Lgmx8CoiES8
_*39315 0:35 |after the release of the past few vlogs ,| Lgmx8CoiES8
_*39316 0:37 |people contacted me with questions .| Lgmx8CoiES8
_*39317 0:40 |questions , i believe , with answers| Lgmx8CoiES8
_*39318 0:42 |with answers that everyone should have access to ,| Lgmx8CoiES8
_*39319 0:45 |so people can be educated .| Lgmx8CoiES8
_*39320 0:48 |i noticed there are times where deaf people| Lgmx8CoiES8
_*39321 0:50 |are curious about something , they prefer to learn| Lgmx8CoiES8
_*39322 0:53 |the information via american sign language ( asl )| Lgmx8CoiES8
_*39323 0:56 |rather than in english . it can be| Lgmx8CoiES8
_*39324 0:59 |frustrating to not have information accessible| Lgmx8CoiES8
_*39325 1:02 |to us in our language .| Lgmx8CoiES8
_*39326 1:05 |it is clear we need more resources in asl .| Lgmx8CoiES8

_*40008 4:38 |> > host : 7th annual , that was many years ago . zhao : yes .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40009 4:42 |and then the girl because of health reasons .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40010 4:45 |> > host : she retired ? zhao : yes , she retired .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40011 4:47 |> > host : she dumped you and made you single .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40012 4:49 |that 's when `` little '' xue appeared .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40013 4:53 |at that time coach yao| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40014 4:55 |brought along just xue ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40015 4:57 |or a bunch of girls to let you choose ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40016 4:59 |> > zhao : that time it was 4 choose 1 .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40017 5:02 |aww man he really brought a bunch ? ! > > zhao : i was finally a lucky guy .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40018 5:06 |> > host : ( pretending to be young zhao ) come have a seat , let me take a look at you .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40019 5:10 |> > zhao : haha no , that would be out of line .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40020 5:12 |back then little xue was n't the best out of those 4 .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40021 5:17 |another girl was supposed to be picked .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40022 5:21 |host : which aspect are you referring to that was n't best ? > > zhao : from a skills standpoint .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40023 5:24 |host : i thought you were talking about she was n't the prettiest . > > shen : in fact not the prettiest .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40024 5:28 |> > shen : then what happened ? host : so why was she chosen ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40025 5:32 |not the most skillful nor the prettiest .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40026 5:34 |our coach would examine athletes ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40027 5:38 |their parents , body type and build ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40028 5:41 |her parents can not be very tall .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40029 5:44 |if they are very tall , and she ends up growing tall also ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40030 5:48 |that would become very strenuous on me .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40031 5:50 |> > host : you wo n't be able to lift her . zhao : also can not be too chubby .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40032 5:52 |parents can not be too chubby . > > host : alright i get it ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40033 5:54 |there 's no way my daughter would make it .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40034 5:57 |right . while scouting our coach really made| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40035 5:59 |careful considerations , and taking everything into account .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40036 6:05 |> > host : so it was totally by chance , and no other factors were involved in the decision process .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40037 6:10 |> > host : and picked her . zhao : yes .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40038 6:13 |i believe at the time , it was just like fate .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40039 6:21 |pairs figure skating is a sport on ice with strength and grace combined .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40040 6:24 |male athletes are demanded to be in good shape with power ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40041 6:28 |so they can complete numerous throws and lifts throughout their routines .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40042 6:32 |elite female athletes are agile , able to keep up with steps and speed of their male counterparts .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40043 6:38 |striking the perfect balance between strength and elegance .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40044 6:47 |if her weight increased ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40045 6:49 |can you tell by feeling with your hands ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40046 6:51 |coach will just look at my face ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40047 6:53 |and be able to see whether i got fatter or skinnier .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40048 6:57 |zhao hongbo would grab my waist ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40049 7:00 |since performing the twist lift he would grab me by my waist .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40050 7:03 |once we do that move > > host : ( pretending to be zhao ) board seems a bit big .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40051 7:08 |we must do that move in practice . once we do it ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40052 7:11 |he 'll be like , `` hmm a bit fat there . ''| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40053 7:13 |> > host : so what do you do ? shen : lose the weight ...| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40054 7:16 |we 've seen another pair| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40055 7:18 |zhang dan , zhang hao at the 2006 olympics ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40056 7:20 |where they had a devastating fall . have you ever had anything like that ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40057 7:24 |actually when i was doing the quad ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40058 7:27 |i also fell very hard , even harder than hers .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40059 7:31 |that is when i fell on the ice ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40060 7:34 |for half a day i could n't get up .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40061 7:36 |then i could n't even breathe . > > zhao : it 's like falling| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40062 7:40 |and feeling like you are in a spasm ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40063 7:44 |where you can neither inhale nor exhale .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40064 7:48 |because when you 've just fallen , usually you ca n't get up right away .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40065 7:51 |need to lay on the ice for a while ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40066 7:54 |regain my vitality , only then you are able to move the body| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40067 7:57 |so once i am able to breathe again| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40068 8:01 |or felt somewhat recovered ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40069 8:03 |he 'll finally pick me up and carry me off the ice .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40070 8:07 |> > host : oh pick you up| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40071 8:10 |that will feel a lot better .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40072 8:12 |in order to do a quadruple-throw jump ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40073 8:16 |knowing once you 've taken off , you 'll fall extremely hard| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40074 8:20 |but little xue still does it , time and time again .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40075 8:24 |i feel this spirit has motivated even ourselves| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40076 8:28 |and urged me to say we need to go all out| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40077 8:31 |for our target of the olympics .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40078 8:34 |that was during the 2002 olympics ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40079 8:36 |which felt like a tough battle| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40080 8:39 |because the gold medal was within our reach ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40081 8:45 |so it was time to go for that gold medal .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40082 8:51 |through their unbelievable courage and perseverance ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40083 8:54 |and gruesome training , shen xue & zhao hongbo| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40084 8:58 |were successful in learning a quad-throw jump ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40085 9:01 |a feat no pair in the world has completed .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40086 9:04 |at the 2002 slc winter olympics| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40087 9:07 |shen & zhao became the first pair ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40088 9:10 |to attempt a quad-throw jump at an international competition .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40089 9:13 |though their attempt was not successful ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40090 9:16 |and they received bronze medals ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40091 9:20 |it was the first ever medals for chinese pairs skating at the olympics .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40092 9:26 |> > host : thank you for staying with us .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40093 9:33 |this quad was actually already completed ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40094 9:36 |but just when i was overflowed with joy ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40095 9:41 |i fell again . > > host : it was n't a failure on the actual element .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40096 9:44 |> > zhao : according to the current judging system| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40097 9:46 |she was already skating for a meter| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40098 9:49 |this element is considered completed . > > shen : completed .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40099 9:52 |her fall should have been deducted from general skating .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40100 9:55 |she held the landing edge long enough already .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40101 9:59 |> > host : got too excited . shen : however , back then it still was n't ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40102 10:03 |the new judging system was not yet in-place ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40103 10:05 |it was another scoring [ old 6.0 ] system . > > host : in the end it was n't ratified .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40104 10:08 |> > shen : yea . zhao : yea , really a shame .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40105 10:10 |> > host : i want to ask this , when you two first started ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40106 10:14 |she was an `` adopted '' little girl , small team member ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40107 10:18 |practicing along with an `` older brother '' , did what she was told .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40108 10:22 |when did you begin to sense| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40109 10:25 |she gradually became an equal member of the team . > > shen : equal .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40110 10:31 |and not the relationship of a coach/student , or older brother/younger sister .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40111 10:38 |> > zhao : wow , we experienced a lot .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40112 10:42 |through kinds of rough experiences like this ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40113 10:47 |i slowly began to sense little xue was growing up , she also changed .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40114 10:51 |i remember one time ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40115 10:53 |which left me with a lasting impression ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40116 10:55 |our whole team of athletes were at a banquet for closing ceremonies ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40117 11:01 |little xue was wearing a red evening gown dress .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40118 11:05 |because there was a banquet after each competition ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40119 11:10 |boys would wear suits , and girls would wear evening gowns .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40120 11:14 |> > host : very formal . zhao : yes .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40121 11:17 |when i saw xue at the elevator , i thought she had transformed| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40122 11:22 |she became more feminine , also very pretty .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40123 11:25 |> > host : sparkling before your eyes . zhao : yes .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40124 11:28 |because we 've spent so much time together ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40125 11:32 |as our coach said , `` aside from sleeping , you 'll always be together . ''| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40126 11:37 |> > host : at the 2003 world championships ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40127 11:39 |i heard xue was injured at that time . > > shen : yes .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40128 11:42 |we 've already arrived at washington , usa , at the competition practices ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40129 11:47 |again practicing a quad-throw jump , but after the landing ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40130 11:51 |my right foot and ankle ( was hurt ) , > > host : did you hear a loud sound inside ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40131 11:57 |no , when i got off the ice , there was huge swelling ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40132 12:01 |so after putting on my blade guards| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40133 12:04 |and walking towards to locker room ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40134 12:07 |after taking a few steps , i could n't even walk .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40135 12:10 |> > host : just got off the ice and could n't walk ? !| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40136 12:12 |i was thinking it was n't a big deal ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40137 12:14 |but that was n't the case when i got back to the hotel room .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40138 12:17 |pretty much i could n't get any sleep for the night .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40139 12:21 |i was sharing a room with another girl .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40140 12:25 |she also had an upcoming competition , i was afraid to disturb her rest .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40141 12:28 |i went in the bathroom and made a bed there with towels .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40142 12:33 |rolled up another towel as my pillow .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40143 12:35 |also had an ice pack , because my leg was in excruciating pain ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40144 12:40 |felt like being pierced by needles , a pulsing type of pain .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40145 12:45 |> > zhao : it was swelling really bad . shen : yea| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40146 12:48 |so while i was icing my foot , i read some magazines| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40147 12:51 |and tried to fall alseep , that 's how i spent the night .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40148 12:55 |in the end we came up with a solution| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40149 12:57 |have injections to make my foot numb ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40150 13:00 |that way my foot would have no feeling .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40151 13:03 |i can do whatever movements , and would n't feel any pain at all .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40152 13:07 |despite the swollen foot being in skates ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40153 13:10 |you would n't feel any pain .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40154 13:12 |in total i had 5 injections ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40155 13:15 |from the practices to the competition .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40156 13:18 |because i was no longer in pain .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40157 13:21 |moreover , i could n't feel anything that 's| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40158 13:23 |below my knee , in the lower leg area| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40159 13:27 |there was no feeling at all .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40160 13:29 |after the first injection , i was skating in practice| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40161 13:34 |i was wobbling on the ice ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40162 13:37 |i could n't stand steady since i had no feeling .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40163 13:41 |so i told zhao you have to hold me tight , since i ca n't balance properly .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40164 13:54 |2003 world figure skating championships in usa| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40165 13:58 |shen xue battled severe injuries and stepped on the ice| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40166 14:04 |with an injection to her foot and sheer determination| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40167 14:08 |won the event and repeated as world champions .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40168 14:26 |just like that you captured the world champion title > > shen : yes| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40169 14:30 |zhao : i remember the second day in the states| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40170 14:34 |i carried xue on my back , taking turns with zhang hao| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40171 14:39 |that was stupid at the time , we should have pushed her in a wheelchair .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40172 14:43 |when she had an injured leg . > > host : no no no , it was a good idea to carry her| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40173 14:47 |carrying her along , to see the white house| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40174 14:49 |we wanted to see it since we were in washington anyway .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40175 14:54 |touring america on piggyback .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40176 14:58 |hongbo did something similar that 's even more famous| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40177 15:02 |you wo n't be able to carry her this time around .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40178 15:05 |you ruptured your achillies tendon back then| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40179 15:08 |how did that happen ? > > zhao : we were training in yunnan| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40180 15:12 |it happened with a jump , during the jump it suddenly ruptured .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40181 15:16 |> > host : oh no you ruptured the whole thing . were you able to hear it ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40182 15:21 |zhao : no i did not hear any sound .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40183 15:24 |> > host : i heard someone say you can hear it when a tendon ruptures .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40184 15:27 |it was through skates ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40185 15:30 |also during takeoff of the jump , > > shen : the toe pick| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40186 15:33 |> > host : which already made a sound shen : yes| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40187 15:36 |your foot was dangling right then ? > > zhao : yea| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40188 15:40 |at the time i was in fear more than anything| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40189 15:44 |not saying i am afraid of pain , but at that moment| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40190 15:48 |suddenly felt i 've lost everything , like i 'm at my wit 's end ( helpless ) .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40191 15:54 |because we 've always taken preventive measures| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40192 15:57 |many people say once a ruptured has occurred| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40193 16:00 |there would be no chance to compete at olympics .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40194 16:04 |that 's what i was afraid of most at the time .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40195 16:06 |> > host : and it really happened . zhao : really happened .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40196 16:09 |shen : i was struck with the flu that day , and was not at the ice rink .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40197 16:12 |i was sleeping in my room| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40198 16:15 |also my forehead was a little dizzy .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40199 16:18 |then the team staff knocked on my door and said| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40200 16:21 |`` pack your bags and go back to beijing ''| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40201 16:25 |i ran out the door to ask what happened .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40202 16:28 |he said zhao hongbo ruptured his tendon .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40203 16:31 |then i went back in the house and thought| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40204 16:33 |originally i had a flu and felt dizzy| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40205 16:35 |plus the fact he said hongbo ruptured his tendon , i felt ... .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40206 16:38 |> > host : you were going to faint . shen : yea and my mind was going blank .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40207 16:43 |> > host : you 've prepared long and hard for the olympics| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40208 16:46 |how long was it till the next games ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40209 16:50 |just a little more than six months .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40210 16:53 |> > host : how long does it typically take for a tendon to grow back in place ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40211 16:59 |for most people , they can resume activities| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40212 17:03 |after 6 months ' time , with small movements . > > zhao : running and jumping .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40213 17:09 |let us briefly explain to our audience what are tendons ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40214 17:13 |basically ... . *talks about beef tendon ( chinese food dish ) * s/z : yes| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40215 17:20 |human tendon was snapped .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40216 17:22 |there 's not much blood flow surrounding tendons| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40217 17:25 |so the recovery process is especially slow .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40218 17:29 |there 's a chance of rupturing it again within 6 months .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40219 17:32 |2nd rupture is common amongst people| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40220 17:35 |for just going down the stairs| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40221 17:39 |you could rupture it with one wrong step .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40222 17:43 |once i finished packing up in my room| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40223 17:46 |he was waiting for me in the car , with his leg elevated| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40224 17:50 |once i got in the car , did n't care about anyone watching| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40225 17:53 |the two of us hugged and cried| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40226 17:57 |we could n't stop crying out loud and did n't care about our surroundings .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40227 18:07 |zhao : in pairs skating , without me| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40228 18:11 |she 's basically handicapped and disabled .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40229 18:15 |> > shen : in pairs , just like a pair of chopsticks| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40230 18:19 |if one breaks , you are only left with one chopstick .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40231 18:24 |> > host : you ca n't eat a meal . shen : yes| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40232 18:27 |that 's even worse than a fork .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40233 18:30 |then what was there to do after crying ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40234 18:32 |go back for rehabilitation ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40235 18:34 |shen : took the next flight back to beijing .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40236 18:37 |when you were crying , was your heart saying the olympics was over ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40237 18:40 |shen : yes , that was the feeling .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40238 18:42 |and kept thinking , `` olympics were over '' .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40239 18:45 |back in beijing , doctor tian de xiang| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40240 18:49 |should say he immediately gave me hope .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40241 18:52 |he said , `` little fellow , no need to be scared or anxious . ''| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40242 18:56 |`` i will definitely make you stand within 6 months . ''| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40243 18:59 |that 's what doctor tian said .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40244 19:01 |> > host : standing up is big difference than being able to jump .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40245 19:04 |at the time i felt an array of hope| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40246 19:07 |like a thin grass in the pond and i grasped it .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40247 19:11 |someone gave me hope .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40248 19:13 |many people helped me during that period ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40249 19:16 |also fans and friends of skating ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40250 19:19 |they made paper cranes and lucky stars| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40251 19:24 |wishing for my speedy recovery .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40252 19:27 |team 's medical staff and doctors gave special attention and care for me .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40253 19:32 |including our coach staff ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40254 19:34 |they attended to my bedside during night shifts , which helped prevent any reinjures .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40255 19:41 |> > host : xue did n't have anybody to practice with ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40256 19:44 |why not take some time off and tend to him ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40257 19:46 |she was even more heart broken than i was .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40258 19:49 |sometimes i 've lost track of how many times she cried in her room .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40259 19:53 |because those were truly challenging times .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40260 19:56 |but in front of me were even more of her smiles .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40261 20:02 |> > host : forced smile . zhao : yup , i am able to feel it .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40262 20:06 |maybe it was during that period ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40263 20:09 |that our personal relationship was able to blossom .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40264 20:12 |> > host : no doubt , true love tested through tough times .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40265 20:19 |hongbo was able to rely on many people for help ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40266 20:21 |of those perhaps xue was the most important one .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40267 20:24 |only then he was able pick himself back up .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40268 20:27 |how long was this after the accident ? s/z : 4 months later .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40269 20:33 |zhao : my leg was still in a cast .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40270 20:36 |all the way up to my thigh .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40271 20:38 |i had to wait 15 days to take the cast off .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40272 20:42 |i said , `` no way , i wo n't last 3 days . ''| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40273 20:45 |i asked them to give me a shorter cast .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40274 20:47 |had a good talk with the doctor ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40275 20:50 |`` you must change it for me . ''| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40276 20:52 |because it was itching too much inside the cast .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40277 20:55 |there was alcohol left over from the surgery ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40278 20:58 |and the cast was applied right on top .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40279 21:03 |the skin was almost peeling off .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40280 21:06 |so i took a chopstick to scratch my leg ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40281 21:10 |but the skin was still feeling really uncomfortable .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40282 21:15 |muscles was also shrinking at a rapid pace| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40283 21:18 |> > host : that 's the key problem . zhao : yes it was shrinking .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40284 21:20 |then my leg became really small .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40285 21:22 |if i do n't use any strength at all within 3 days| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40286 21:25 |my leg was becoming small fast . > > host : just 3 days ! ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40287 21:28 |zhao : i said no way , and talked to the doctor| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40288 21:31 |fitted with a smaller one , so at least i can exercise my own leg a bit .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40289 21:34 |then within a week i started training| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40290 21:36 |core , back , and upper body strength .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40291 21:39 |> > host : you were off ice for 4 months , did you still know how to skate ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40292 21:44 |zhao : just like i was drunk , really .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40293 21:46 |basically it was that feeling , i was floating .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40294 21:49 |this leg had many protective mechanism applied .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40295 21:54 |many layers of taping| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40296 21:58 |which made it really stiff .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40297 22:05 |normally it takes us 5 minutes to tie a pair of skates| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40298 22:07 |since we are already used to it .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40299 22:12 |it took him half an hour to lace up his skates| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40300 22:16 |his tendon was not very solid at all . > > host : that 's to be expected .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40301 22:21 |shen : so i pressured him to jump . > > host : are n't you afraid he 'll reinjure himself ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40302 22:25 |well it was really close to the olympics ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40303 22:29 |we were going in one week . zhao : yes .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40304 22:38 |shen : my thinking was this| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40305 22:40 |if you can not do this element ( 3t )| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40306 22:42 |you wo n't be competing for the olympic gold . > > host : just like you did n't even go .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40307 22:45 |shen : then what 's the point of going ? might as well not go at all .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40308 22:48 |> > host : what was he saying ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40309 22:51 |he was afraid of doing that jump ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40310 22:54 |popping left and right .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40311 22:56 |i was standing there watching him jump| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40312 22:58 |i finally said play our program music .| 28EMyPAYjZk

_*40315 23:06 |another pop , keep trying .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40316 23:08 |> > host : popped so he did n't even do the move ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40317 23:10 |it was a triple , he stopped at two revolutions .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40318 23:13 |zhao : i also fell a few times .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40319 23:16 |shen : fell a few times . > > zhao : those falls made her anxious .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40320 23:21 |there were 6-7 people at the rink ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40321 23:24 |lined up by the boards| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40322 23:27 |with lots of people looking on .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40323 23:29 |aside from her screaming , `` play the music ''| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40324 23:32 |everyone else was absolutely silent .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40325 23:34 |my falls made her angry and pissed her off .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40326 23:37 |i said , `` if my break my foot again , i 'll kill you all . ''| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40327 23:43 |> > host : you said it , kill them all . zhao : yup| 28EMyPAYjZk

_*40329 23:48 |`` then you keep jumping . ''| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40330 23:50 |she 's more ruthless than me .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40331 23:53 |then both of us continued to jump| 28EMyPAYjZk

_*40439 33:00 |should have come on your show earlier .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40440 33:06 |shen : other times he 'll be like , `` one , two , three , laugh ! ''| 28EMyPAYjZk

_*40442 33:15 |he 'll be like , `` tickle tickle '' which i also can not hold my laughter .| 28EMyPAYjZk

_*40455 34:19 |i heard xue wrote a love letter while in vancouver .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40456 34:22 |> > shen : that 's not called a love letter . host : then what is it called ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40457 34:27 |> > shen : because feb14-15 were the competition dates .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40458 34:32 |feb14 so happens to be valentines ' day . > > host : `` so happens ? '' it just is !| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40459 34:38 |it was also the first portion of our competition , the short program .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40460 34:43 |so just before that , i wrote him a greeting card .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40461 34:47 |> > host : did you bring it ? want to read it out ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40462 34:56 |> > shen : so i wrote , dear hubby hongbo , wish you happy valentine 's| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40463 35:01 |our feelings are the most complicated , during this year 's valentines '| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40464 35:05 |but we 've already done everything we can , already sacrificed what was necessary ,| 28EMyPAYjZk

_*40473 35:56 |> > zhao : another starting point has begun ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40474 36:00 |to provide something in figure skating for china 's next generation .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40475 36:03 |> > shen : we are only retiring from competition , but we wo n't retire from figure skating .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40476 36:09 |our accomplishments throughout the years , are developed by the state ( china ) .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40477 36:14 |they met numerous conditions for us .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40478 36:18 |> > shen : this is something you can not do in other countries .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40479 36:22 |> > zhao : i think especially for figure skating ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40480 36:25 |needs enormous backing from the powerful state .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40481 36:30 |since in america and europe , figure skating is believed to be a luxurious sport for the rich .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40482 36:35 |take our costumes for example , the design and tailoring are made to be exceptionally gorgeous .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40483 36:43 |then music for our programs also require editing and mixing to finest details .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40484 36:52 |all these requires significant amount of money as backing .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40485 36:56 |> > host : so from now on , you would like to do more to give back to the country .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40486 37:01 |> > zhao : yes that 's how i feel . shen : the state has provided us with| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40487 37:04 |many years of support . some of those things are visible , some are not visible .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40488 37:10 |including medical staff , scientists , many people are serving one athlete .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40489 37:17 |when we received our gold medals , we also said this during on-site interviews .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40490 37:24 |> > zhao : what we said most was our gratitude .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40491 37:28 |this gold medal does n't just belong to the two of us , it belongs to the world of figure skating ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40492 37:32 |as well as paying back everyone who has contributed to our programs and journey .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40493 37:37 |it is the wish of everyone .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40494 37:40 |what was most lucky for us , is to be able to step on this stage .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40495 37:44 |to fulfill this destiny . > > host : well said !| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40496 37:49 |> > host : this is a splendid change of stage for you| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40497 37:53 |beginning a new journey . we give you our blessing . s/z : thank you .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40498 38:00 |i think you still have another dream , which you have n't told us yet ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40499 38:03 |you should have a child . is that in your plans ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40500 38:10 |> > zhao : next year , perhaps .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40501 38:15 |> > host : you guys will succeed for sure .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40502 38:19 |because the lucky star is already following you .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40503 38:21 |if and when you have a son or daughter ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40504 38:26 |would you allow them to be involved in figure skating ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40505 38:31 |> > shen : i think so , first we 'll let them try . then provide guidance in that direction .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40506 38:36 |in our house we already have kids figure skating boots . > > zhao : we have it all ready .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40507 38:41 |> > host : we originally prepared a small gift for you , and that 's a pair of skates .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40508 38:45 |would like to give it to your future children , but if you 've already prepared your own ,| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40509 38:50 |it makes us seem a little redundant , do you still want them ?| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40510 38:55 |> > shen : yes , i want them . yup .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40511 38:58 |> > host : then let us give them to you .| 28EMyPAYjZk

_*40515 39:12 |your pair of white will be perfect for a girl .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40516 39:16 |> > host : boys wear black , girls wear white .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40517 39:20 |> > host : how about this , let 's make a pact . for a girl , > > shen : will do figure skating .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40518 39:24 |> > host : for a boy i 'll give another pair of hockey skates . > > s/z : thank you .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40519 39:31 |> > host : at the end of the show , we still have one more present .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40520 39:36 |it 's a tradition on our show `` amazing couples '' .| 28EMyPAYjZk

_*40522 39:45 |hope as husband , zhao hongbo will put it on his wife shen xue .| 28EMyPAYjZk

_*40524 39:57 |or if you have any other ideas , that would be even better .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40525 40:02 |> > zhao : what else can i do ? host : or you can sing her a romantic song .| 28EMyPAYjZk
_*40526 40:07 |> > zhao : i have n't sang in a long time . host : so will you sweet talk or sing ?| 28EMyPAYjZk

_*40948 0:04 |hi . today i will discuss the legal concept of least restrictive environment , or lre for short| rERAoliF3-0
_*40949 0:17 |first i am going to discuss the concept of| rERAoliF3-0
_*40950 0:20 |lre in general and then i will discuss how this concept applies to deaf and hard of hearing| rERAoliF3-0
_*40951 0:34 |individual educational needs , the child is placed with non disabled students .| rERAoliF3-0
_*40952 0:43 |peers . therefore , each school must ensure two things :| rERAoliF3-0
_*40953 0:45 |( i ) to the maximum extent appropriate , children with disabilities , are educated with children| rERAoliF3-0
_*40954 0:52 |who are nondisabled ; and ( ii ) special classes , or separate schooling| rERAoliF3-0
_*40955 0:58 |from the regular educational environment occurs only if the disability is so severe that education| rERAoliF3-0
_*40956 1:09 |idea lre provision [ cfr 300.114 ( a ) ] ) when discussing lre , the iep team should consider| rERAoliF3-0
_*40957 1:27 |regular classes ? remember , there is no specific standard / placement| rERAoliF3-0
_*40958 1:39 |last has the iep team considered all possible placements .| rERAoliF3-0
_*40959 1:45 |sometimes the iep team assumes that lre is tied to the local program . in actuality ,| rERAoliF3-0
_*40960 1:54 |lre is not place-specific . it is entirely placed on the needs of the child .| rERAoliF3-0
_*40961 2:09 |by law when discussing the educational needs of the child , the iep team should be presented with| rERAoliF3-0
_*40962 2:14 |and discuss all possible placement options . now the concept of lre when applied to deaf| rERAoliF3-0
_*40963 2:23 |and hard of hearing children can be very challenging . often the iep team follows the same pattern when| rERAoliF3-0
_*40964 2:34 |considering lre . first they consider local programs . then they move on to a local program| rERAoliF3-0
_*40965 2:47 |that has additional support like interpreters etc . if that is not effective , they move on| rERAoliF3-0
_*40966 2:54 |to a local program with a self-contained classroom where they are with other children with disabilities .| rERAoliF3-0
_*40967 2:59 |finally , they will send the student to a school for the deaf . but here is the question , is this process effective ?| rERAoliF3-0
_*40968 3:11 |in all honesty , no .| rERAoliF3-0
_*40969 3:12 |according to federal register legal interpretation of lre applied to deaf and hard of hearing| rERAoliF3-0
_*40970 3:23 |students is often misapplied and misinterpreted . federal interpretation says that the unique| rERAoliF3-0
_*40971 3:30 |communication needs of deaf and hard of hearing students must be addressed when discussing| rERAoliF3-0
_*40972 3:42 |historically placement options are considered over time , at the annual iep meeting or even| rERAoliF3-0
_*40973 3:47 |every few years . all the while losing precious educational opportunities for the child .| rERAoliF3-0
_*40974 3:58 |in truth , this process does not fit the needs of deaf and hard of hearing students . access| rERAoliF3-0
_*40975 4:05 |to communication is a key factor when considering lre . per law the iep team should consider| rERAoliF3-0
_*40976 4:19 |what does this mean ? how is that defined ? this should be based on current assessment ,| rERAoliF3-0
_*40977 4:32 |data , and observations . for some students `` direct communication '' means through the use| rERAoliF3-0
_*40978 4:41 |of american sign language without an interpreter . for others it means spoken language with signed| rERAoliF3-0
_*40979 4:47 |support . some will also use additional technology or tools to access communication . the deaf| rERAoliF3-0
_*40980 5:03 |team should consider : 1. the deaf or hard of hearing child 's language| rERAoliF3-0
_*40981 5:10 |and communication needs 2. providing opportunities for direct communication| rERAoliF3-0
_*40982 5:17 |with peers and professional personnel in the child 's own language| rERAoliF3-0
_*40983 5:22 |3. making sure that programming meets the academic level of the child and provides for| rERAoliF3-0
_*40984 5:30 |a full range of needs 4.all programming provides opportunities for| rERAoliF3-0
_*40985 5:37 |direct instruction in the child 's language and communication mode .| rERAoliF3-0
_*40986 5:41 |now , not all deaf and hard of hearing children communicate in the same way . the point is| rERAoliF3-0
_*40987 5:54 |and combine that with the educational needs of the child and consider all program options| rERAoliF3-0
_*40988 6:04 |and lre can be determined .| rERAoliF3-0

_*40995 0:18 |those that were much older| tbIo9qztEn0

_*41002 0:44 |the pearl tried and tried to tell them something| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41003 0:48 |but they threw the pearl and broke it into many pieces| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41004 0:52 |the pieces went through a tunnel| tbIo9qztEn0

_*41008 1:34 |and miraculously the pearl came back together| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41009 1:37 |as guii put girl in the children 's hands| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41010 1:42 |she told them that only superheroes could listen to what the pearl had to say| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41011 1:48 |nobody knew when the pearl said to the children| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41012 1:52 |however from that day the children discovered| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41013 1:56 |that older people are like everybody else| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41014 2:00 |and they are very valuable| tbIo9qztEn0

_*41016 2:07 |including their parents soon they| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41017 2:10 |realized how important it is to talk with others| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41018 2:14 |and listen to them the children 's stop thinking of| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41019 2:18 |older people they knew as dummies and became their friends| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41020 2:23 |the older people showed the children the beauty| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41021 2:26 |and peace that allowed them to enjoy a flower| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41022 2:30 |or a sunset| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41023 2:40 |the older people also showed the children how important it is to respect| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41024 2:45 |others and themselves| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41025 2:52 |these children changed and seemed happier| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41026 2:56 |others who saw the children learned from them| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41027 2:59 |how to respect everybody and each other| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41028 3:02 |soon they all talked with each other| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41029 3:05 |do n't very peaceful and their lives have more meaning| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41030 3:10 |everybody learned the importance of| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41031 3:13 |all these elements as part of a philosophy of life| tbIo9qztEn0
_*41032 3:17 |which allowed them to save their city and themselves| tbIo9qztEn0

_*41937 0:38 |quality resolution . the response of the touchscreen on kindle| 9DRhUCLt6tA
_*41938 0:43 |fire is excellent . reactions to swiping , sliding , tapping and zooming all work well .| 9DRhUCLt6tA

_*41947 0:13 |hi everybody , my name is bhavya .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41948 0:19 |om amriteshwaryai namah| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41949 0:21 |i want to tell you a story about what happened today .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41950 0:27 |last night , i was talking with amma , which i always do .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41951 0:33 |i told amma `` will you meet me tomorrow at 3:00 pm in person ? ''| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41952 0:44 |i asked with a child-like innocence .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41953 0:54 |the next day which is today , this morning ...| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41954 0:59 |i was thinking about 3pm `` how will amma meet me in person ? ''| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41955 1:05 |if i stay home all day , how will amma meet me ? i 'm home alone .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41956 1:10 |will she knock on the door ?| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41957 1:13 |or would something happen to make me leave before 3:00pm ?| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41958 1:18 |will i meet a person at 3pm ?| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41959 1:22 |my plan for today was maybe go to the grocery store . i needed to buy something today .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41960 1:35 |later this afternoon , i realized i also needed to the post office too ...| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41961 1:39 |..to drop off the packages| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41962 1:41 |i had n't decided yet when to go , but it has to be before 5pm .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41963 1:44 |so i took it easy with no rush nor did i plan to leave before 3pm .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41964 1:55 |i allow amma do her own way of letting me know .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41965 2:02 |i do n't decide . i do n't think .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41966 2:07 |i just focused on work which i do online at home .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41967 2:12 |while i was working , i noticed the time get closer to 2:00pm| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41968 2:20 |i thought i 'd just keep focused on working until 4pm ...| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41969 2:25 |..then go to the post office and grocery store .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41970 2:29 |this was my plan at 4pm , as long as it was before 5pm .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41971 2:33 |as i continued to work then somehow the internet wi-fi disconnected .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41972 2:52 |i looked to see what time it was ... it was 2:30pm| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41973 2:57 |whenever the internet gets disconnected , i have to reboot my laptop .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41974 3:05 |i looked at the time `` 2:30pm '' , i realized it was a message from amma that it was time to leave .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41975 3:14 |i knew it was amma doing it was amma 's way of letting me know to leave right now .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41976 3:22 |ok , i got my orders , my bag , put my shoes on , and left .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41977 3:29 |walked to the car , got in , and sat for a moment . i thought where should i go first ?| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41978 3:34 |i thought to go to the po first , but then i remembered i had a box of indian spiritual books in the backseat .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41979 3:45 |books about swami vivekananda . he 's a famous swami from the 1800 's .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41980 3:56 |i had about 10 books about him that he wrote .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41981 4:01 |i was n't planning to read these books , so i thought it would be a good idea to donate to the ramakrishna monastery 7 minutes away .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41982 4:18 |yesterday i had gone through some of my books and thought to donate them| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41983 4:25 |so that 's why i put them in my car to drop them off .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41984 4:35 |the thought appeared in my mind that i should go there to the monastery first to drop off these books .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41985 4:41 |so i thought `` ok '' and saw that i had plenty of time . visitor 's hours are open at 3 to 5| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41986 4:49 |or 10am or ummm ... anyways ... the bookstore is open all day from 10 to 5pm .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41987 4:57 |you can go there anytime in the afternoon .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41988 4:59 |anyways , i decided to go there first , the time was ... .wait , i was driving on my way there , then arrived there| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41989 5:08 |no rush , no thoughts of hurrying .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41990 5:11 |i noticed that it was getting close to 3pm and thought what an interesting choice of place to go to right before 3pm .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41991 5:17 |i did not plan this at all . this thought appeared in my mind out of the blue .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41992 5:21 |so i arrived at 2:38pm .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41993 5:25 |i thought to myself `` i 'm here now , who , or how will amma meet me at 3pm ? how ? who ? what ? '' i do n't know .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41994 5:35 |ok , what should i do first ? i thought i should go to the bookstore first| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41995 5:41 |and bring the box of donated books . i walked towards the bookstore .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41996 5:46 |the door was locked . ok the person who works there had left probably temporarily .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41997 5:56 |i had no idea when that person would return , so i stood there .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41998 6:03 |a man happened to be walking by in front of the bookstore too looking at his phone .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*41999 6:09 |he spoke to me . i did not understand what he said . i said i was deaf and asked him to repeat .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42000 6:16 |he said that the person would come at 3pm .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42001 6:20 |i thought that was interesting and funny that he said `` 3pm '' .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42002 6:25 |so i decided to sit on the bench and wait .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42003 6:34 |as i waited a bit , i felt the impulse to get up and walk . so i left the box of books in front of the door .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42004 6:47 |they will find it and would explain to them what it is later .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42005 6:52 |i started walking around . where should i go ? to the mediation room ? or to see the fishes ? or go on the trail ?| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42006 7:05 |or go on the grass . who knows ? so i walked and felt guided towards the fish pond .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42007 7:12 |walked towards where the fish pond was . i will post a video about them from awhile back .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42008 7:22 |i always go visit the koi fishes . they have a small pond with a few beautiful koi fish .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42009 7:34 |i walked to the pond , sat on the grass , looked at the fishes and said `` hello ! ''| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42010 7:43 |i immediately noticed something new . everytime i went to visit this pond before , i always saw the same koi fish , never saw any other kind .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42011 7:54 |today was the first time i saw a new different fish . it was a huge whitish , ivory..catfish..albino . it was huge !| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42012 8:18 |i never saw it before . it was swimming in front of me and looked at me briefly .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42013 8:25 |i said `` hello '' to it and asked `` are you amma ? '' ( laugh ) i was being silly and just sat there looking at it .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42014 8:32 |i thought it was so beautiful . other koi fish came over to say hello and greet me .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42015 8:40 |i sat there wondering `` at 3pm , what will happen ? i do n't know . '' i had no watch nor phone no purse with me to check the time| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42016 8:52 |i did not know what time it was . how would i know ? who knows ?| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42017 8:57 |so i got up on my feet and started walking towards the meditation room .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42018 9:02 |it 's really like a temple , but it 's dark inside a small round building . it 's really itself a meditation shrine room .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42019 9:20 |i went to the door , took off my shoes , my glasses , and keys before entering .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42020 9:27 |i opened the door and saw nobody there .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42021 9:32 |when i entered , my eyes met ramakrishna 's face in front of the room . i will post a picture of him .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42022 9:51 |they have a red digital clock in the front next to the picture , so i know what time it is .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42023 10:01 |when i opened the door and entered , my eyes saw ramakrishna 's picture immediately| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42024 10:10 |and then i read the clock at 3:00pm , exactly at 3:00pm !| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42025 10:17 |who did i meet at 3:00pm ? ramakrishna !| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42026 10:27 |that 's amma meeting me at 3:00pm as ramakrishna .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42027 10:39 |wow the time perfectly at 3:00pm ! that 's beautiful !| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42028 10:46 |i did not think of the time nor hurried . i did not plan my steps . how ?| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42029 10:54 |i noticed a new fish that i never saw before , enjoying the moment .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42030 11:03 |then i got up and walked around . interesting !| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42031 11:07 |internet ... remember when the internet disconnected ? got up , ... my things ... went to the car ...| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42032 11:20 |amazing ! how perfect it flowed beautifully to the perfect time of entering the room and meeting ramakrishna exactly 3:00pm .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42033 11:39 |oh by the way , the 108 names of amma has three names associated with ramakrishna 's name which i will show you . wonderful ! o ' amma ! namaste .| vFyMt9NDbSM

_*42035 12:40 |he was a famous saint from india the 1800 's .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42036 12:49 |who was ramakrishna ? he was an incarnation of god .| vFyMt9NDbSM
_*42037 12:58 |he gave us the philosophy of vedanta .| vFyMt9NDbSM

_*44114 5:09 |let them have your hands if you remain calm| pAvewviVwjY
_*44115 5:14 |when you arrive at the police station the cops will likely come off| pAvewviVwjY
_*44116 5:17 |or be placed in front of your body to ensure that you can communicate| pAvewviVwjY

_*44131 6:12 |who is impartial officers are not allowed to use your family members| pAvewviVwjY
_*44132 6:17 |or friends to interpret for you police officers are also| pAvewviVwjY
_*44133 6:21 |unable to serve as impartial interpreters so| pAvewviVwjY
_*44134 6:24 |even if the officer is signing you should wait| pAvewviVwjY
_*44135 6:27 |for the certified interpreter to arrive even after the interpreter arrives| pAvewviVwjY
_*44136 6:32 |do not talk to the police until your attorney arrives| pAvewviVwjY

_*44369 1:19 |how can that be ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44370 1:22 |i have always been confused by that .| WMl53FV052U
_*44371 1:26 |have you ever wondered why there are so many| WMl53FV052U
_*44372 1:28 |different churches and practices and beliefs ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44373 1:30 |is it possible that every| WMl53FV052U
_*44374 1:31 |denomination is right ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44375 1:33 |does god approve of this kind of division and confusion ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44376 1:36 |and does it even really matter ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44377 1:38 |why are there so many different churches ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44378 1:41 |does it matter to god ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44379 1:43 |is he pleased with the current situation in the religious world ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44380 1:46 |if i were to ask you| WMl53FV052U
_*44381 1:48 |exactly how many different churches exist in the world today ...| WMl53FV052U
_*44382 1:51 |what would you say ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44383 1:52 |you would probably say ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44384 1:53 |i do n't know ... a lot i guess .| WMl53FV052U
_*44385 1:55 |and that would be right .| WMl53FV052U
_*44386 1:56 |there are a lot !| WMl53FV052U
_*44387 1:57 |in fact i looked this up recently .| WMl53FV052U
_*44388 1:59 |i found that there are approximately 38,000 different churches .| WMl53FV052U
_*44389 2:04 |38,000 !| WMl53FV052U
_*44390 2:06 |friends , that is amazing .| WMl53FV052U
_*44391 2:08 |and think about how confusing this can be| WMl53FV052U
_*44392 2:10 |for a person who is seeking the truth .| WMl53FV052U
_*44393 2:11 |because you have one church over here| WMl53FV052U
_*44394 2:13 |that is teaching this practice| WMl53FV052U
_*44395 2:14 |and another church that| WMl53FV052U
_*44396 2:16 |is teaching the opposite .| WMl53FV052U
_*44397 2:18 |one church says| WMl53FV052U
_*44398 2:18 |that item a is sinful| WMl53FV052U
_*44399 2:20 |and another church says| WMl53FV052U
_*44400 2:21 |that item a is mandatory .| WMl53FV052U
_*44401 2:23 |who is right ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44402 2:24 |can they both be right ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44403 2:25 |and of course , some people will tell you , `` that is good ! ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44404 2:27 |`` it is good to have variety . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44405 2:29 |`` just attend the church of your choice . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44406 2:31 |and they will say , `` one church is just as good as another . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44407 2:34 |`` we are all going to the same place anyway . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44408 2:37 |`` there are just different paths leading us to the same location . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44409 2:41 |dear friend , may i respectfully tell you| WMl53FV052U
_*44410 2:44 |that the bible says| WMl53FV052U
_*44411 2:45 |`` god is not the author of confusion '' ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44412 2:47 |when i read my new testament ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44413 2:49 |i read about only one church .| WMl53FV052U
_*44414 2:53 |but when i look around me today ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44415 2:55 |and i see those who profess christianity ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44416 2:57 |i see thousands .| WMl53FV052U
_*44417 2:59 |now the question is| WMl53FV052U
_*44418 3:00 |how did we get from one to thousands ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44419 3:04 |and the answer is ...| WMl53FV052U
_*44420 3:05 |something went wrong .| WMl53FV052U
_*44421 3:06 |something went severely wrong .| WMl53FV052U
_*44422 3:09 |but you see , it did n't go wrong with god .| WMl53FV052U
_*44423 3:11 |it went wrong with man .| WMl53FV052U
_*44424 3:14 |now , here is the first point i want us to observe| WMl53FV052U
_*44425 3:16 |as we consider this subject together ;| WMl53FV052U
_*44426 3:18 |and that is ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44427 3:19 |in the bible we read about only one church .| WMl53FV052U
_*44428 3:23 |i want you to use your imagination| WMl53FV052U
_*44429 3:25 |with me for a minute .| WMl53FV052U
_*44430 3:26 |i want you to imagine that| WMl53FV052U
_*44431 3:28 |there is such a thing as a time machine ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44432 3:30 |and i want you to imagine that you can get in this time machine .| WMl53FV052U
_*44433 3:33 |and travel back to the first century| WMl53FV052U
_*44434 3:35 |to the day that the lord established his church .| WMl53FV052U
_*44435 3:39 |you get out and you see all of these converts to christianity ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44436 3:42 |about 3,000 of them .| WMl53FV052U
_*44437 3:43 |you walk up to one of them and you ask him ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44438 3:46 |`` sir , i would like to know| WMl53FV052U
_*44439 3:49 |what denomination did you just become a part of ? ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44440 3:52 |what would he say ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44441 3:53 |he would probably say ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44442 3:55 |`` i do n't know what you are talking about . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44443 3:57 |`` i mean what church did you become a part of ? ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44444 3:59 |`` was it the methodist ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44445 4:00 |or catholic ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44446 4:01 |or the baptist ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44447 4:02 |which one was it ? ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44448 4:03 |he 'd say| WMl53FV052U
_*44449 4:04 |`` sir , i do n't know what you are talking about . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44450 4:06 |`` i have never heard of a denomination . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44451 4:08 |`` i have never heard of these groups you 're discussing . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44452 4:10 |`` all i know is| WMl53FV052U
_*44453 4:12 |that i became a part of the church that belongs to jesus christ . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44454 4:15 |`` the church of christ ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44455 4:17 |and that would be exactly right .| WMl53FV052U
_*44456 4:19 |because there was only one .| WMl53FV052U
_*44457 4:22 |acts 2:47 says| WMl53FV052U
_*44458 4:23 |`` the lord added to the church daily| WMl53FV052U
_*44459 4:26 |those who were being saved . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44460 4:28 |and this fits perfectly with| WMl53FV052U
_*44461 4:29 |what jesus promised in matthew 16:18| WMl53FV052U
_*44462 4:32 |he promised `` ... upon this rock i will build my church . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44463 4:36 |the apostle paul ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44464 4:38 |later echoes the sentiment of the one church| WMl53FV052U
_*44465 4:40 |as he is speaking to the elders in ephesus| WMl53FV052U
_*44466 4:41 |he tells them to `` shepherd the church of god| WMl53FV052U
_*44467 4:44 |which he purchased with his own blood . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44468 4:47 |acts 20:28| WMl53FV052U
_*44469 4:48 |in the book of ephesians| WMl53FV052U
_*44470 4:49 |we are told that god has put all things under christ 's feet| WMl53FV052U
_*44471 4:52 |and gave him to be the head over all things to the church| WMl53FV052U
_*44472 4:55 |which is his body ... ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44473 4:57 |and so the church of christ| WMl53FV052U
_*44474 4:59 |and the body of christ are the same thing .| WMl53FV052U
_*44475 5:01 |and then the singularity of the church| WMl53FV052U
_*44476 5:03 |is nailed down in ephesians 4:4| WMl53FV052U
_*44477 5:05 |when he says `` there is one body . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44478 5:10 |dear friend ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44479 5:11 |when one reads the new testament| WMl53FV052U
_*44480 5:13 |he is impressed by the fact| WMl53FV052U
_*44481 5:15 |that there existed only one church .| WMl53FV052U
_*44482 5:18 |well , what if someone came along and wanted| WMl53FV052U
_*44483 5:20 |to start some different divisions| WMl53FV052U
_*44484 5:22 |of that one church ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44485 5:23 |different denominations if you will .| WMl53FV052U
_*44486 5:26 |would that be okay ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44487 5:27 |and the answer to that question is , no .| WMl53FV052U
_*44488 5:29 |that would not be okay .| WMl53FV052U
_*44489 5:30 |i want you to listen to the words of the apostle paul| WMl53FV052U
_*44490 5:33 |as he writes to the church in corinth .| WMl53FV052U
_*44491 5:35 |he says `` now i plead with you brethren| WMl53FV052U
_*44492 5:38 |by the name of our lord jesus christ| WMl53FV052U
_*44493 5:40 |that you all speak the same thing ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44494 5:43 |and that there be no divisions among you ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44495 5:46 |but that you be perfectly joined together| WMl53FV052U
_*44496 5:48 |in the same mind| WMl53FV052U
_*44497 5:50 |and the same judgment . '' i corinthians 1:10| WMl53FV052U
_*44498 5:53 |now friends how does that mesh with what we see in the religious world today ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44499 5:57 |with all of the different denominations| WMl53FV052U
_*44500 5:59 |and divisions| WMl53FV052U
_*44501 6:00 |and sects that are all teaching different things ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44502 6:03 |and the answer is ... it does not mesh at all .| WMl53FV052U
_*44503 6:06 |it is completely foreign to the new testament concept| WMl53FV052U
_*44504 6:09 |of the church .| WMl53FV052U
_*44505 6:11 |now , more specifically , what was the problem| WMl53FV052U
_*44506 6:13 |with the church in corinth ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44507 6:15 |i want you to listen again .| WMl53FV052U
_*44508 6:16 |this is verse twelve .| WMl53FV052U
_*44509 6:17 |paul says| WMl53FV052U
_*44510 6:18 |`` now i say this , that| WMl53FV052U
_*44511 6:19 |each of you says ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44512 6:20 |`` i am of paul , '' or `` i am of apollos , '' or| WMl53FV052U
_*44513 6:24 |`` i am of cephas , '' or `` i am of christ . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44514 6:26 |is christ divided ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44515 6:28 |was paul crucified for you ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44516 6:30 |or were you baptized in the name of paul ? ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44517 6:33 |you see , within the first century church ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44518 6:35 |we see the seeds of denominationalism .| WMl53FV052U
_*44519 6:38 |some were starting to hold to paul ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44520 6:40 |while others were holding to apollos others to cephas , to peter ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44521 6:44 |and others to christ .| WMl53FV052U
_*44522 6:46 |divisions were starting to form| WMl53FV052U
_*44523 6:48 |and paul , by the inspiration of the holy spirit ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44524 6:51 |condemns this . and he makes it clear that this is not of god .| WMl53FV052U
_*44525 6:55 |okay , as we seek to answer the question ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44526 6:58 |why are there so many churches ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44527 7:00 |i want us to notice that| WMl53FV052U
_*44528 7:01 |god predicted that there would be a departure from the new testament pattern .| WMl53FV052U
_*44529 7:06 |you see , despite the clarity of the new testament| WMl53FV052U
_*44530 7:09 |with regard to the oneness of the church| WMl53FV052U
_*44531 7:11 |and despite the warnings against division| WMl53FV052U
_*44532 7:13 |god knew that divisions would come .| WMl53FV052U
_*44533 7:16 |in fact , the bible foretells of it and warns against it several times .| WMl53FV052U
_*44534 7:21 |one of these warnings comes from a passage we mentioned a moment ago| WMl53FV052U
_*44535 7:24 |it 's the conversation between paul and the ephesian elders| WMl53FV052U
_*44536 7:27 |he tells them to `` shepherd the church ... ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44537 7:31 |which was purchased py the blood of christ| WMl53FV052U
_*44538 7:33 |he says that `` for i know this ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44539 7:35 |that after my departure| WMl53FV052U
_*44540 7:36 |savage wolves will come in among you ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44541 7:38 |not sparing the flock .| WMl53FV052U
_*44542 7:40 |also from among yourselves men will rise up ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44543 7:43 |speaking perverse things ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44544 7:44 |to draw away the disciples after themselves .| WMl53FV052U
_*44545 7:47 |now , it is interesting that paul tells the leaders| WMl53FV052U
_*44546 7:50 |of this church of this congregation| WMl53FV052U
_*44547 7:53 |that a departure would come from them .| WMl53FV052U
_*44548 7:56 |and the reason that this is so interesting| WMl53FV052U
_*44549 7:58 |is because one of the first departures in the church| WMl53FV052U
_*44550 8:00 |was with regard to its leadership and its organization .| WMl53FV052U
_*44551 8:05 |now , another warning concerning departure| WMl53FV052U
_*44552 8:07 |is found in i timothy chapter four| WMl53FV052U
_*44553 8:09 |let 's read this one together .| WMl53FV052U
_*44554 8:12 |it says , `` now the spirit speaks expressly| WMl53FV052U
_*44555 8:15 |( that is the holy spirit is speaking very plainly here )| WMl53FV052U
_*44556 8:17 |that in the latter times some will depart from the faith ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44557 8:22 |giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44558 8:26 |speaking lies and hypocrisy ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44559 8:27 |having their own conscience seared with a hot iron ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44560 8:31 |forbidding to marry ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44561 8:32 |and commanding to abstain from foods which god created to be received| WMl53FV052U
_*44562 8:36 |with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44563 8:40 |we will see in history that| WMl53FV052U
_*44564 8:42 |two of the specific departures| WMl53FV052U
_*44565 8:45 |that will later take place relate to forbidding marriage| WMl53FV052U
_*44566 8:48 |and not being allowed to eat certain foods .| WMl53FV052U
_*44567 8:50 |now , thus far| WMl53FV052U
_*44568 8:52 |we see that according to the new testament pattern| WMl53FV052U
_*44569 8:54 |there was only one church ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44570 8:57 |but we also see that| WMl53FV052U
_*44571 8:58 |god predicted that there would be a departure| WMl53FV052U
_*44572 9:01 |from that new testament pattern .| WMl53FV052U
_*44573 9:03 |alright , let 's get to the key question .| WMl53FV052U
_*44574 9:05 |why are there so many churches today ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44575 9:09 |how did a basic bible belief system| WMl53FV052U
_*44576 9:13 |with a unified group of people| WMl53FV052U
_*44577 9:15 |turn into literally thousands of different denominations| WMl53FV052U
_*44578 9:18 |with different practices and different beliefs ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44579 9:22 |well , history tells us that| WMl53FV052U
_*44580 9:23 |very early on| WMl53FV052U
_*44581 9:24 |there came along splinter groups| WMl53FV052U
_*44582 9:26 |who had ideas and doctrines contrary to that of the first century church| WMl53FV052U
_*44583 9:30 |and contrary to the doctrine that they had received and practiced .| WMl53FV052U
_*44584 9:33 |some of these groups include ;| WMl53FV052U
_*44585 9:35 |the gnostics around a.d. 125 ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44586 9:37 |the montanists around a.d. 156 ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44587 9:40 |the manicheans around a.d. 244 , and| WMl53FV052U
_*44588 9:43 |the novations around a.d. 251 .| WMl53FV052U
_*44589 9:46 |now , one of the largest and most significant divisions| WMl53FV052U
_*44590 9:49 |that relates to the early church| WMl53FV052U
_*44591 9:51 |relates to its leadership| WMl53FV052U
_*44592 9:53 |and involved the roman emperor by the name of constantine .| WMl53FV052U
_*44593 9:57 |now , from the beginning of god 's plan| WMl53FV052U
_*44594 9:59 |it was to have elders and deacons in the church .| WMl53FV052U
_*44595 10:02 |and you can read about this in i timothy and titus .| WMl53FV052U
_*44596 10:05 |and these elders| WMl53FV052U
_*44597 10:07 |had authority| WMl53FV052U
_*44598 10:08 |only over the congregations where they were members .| WMl53FV052U
_*44599 10:11 |that is the way god established it .| WMl53FV052U
_*44600 10:13 |each congregation was autonomous .| WMl53FV052U
_*44601 10:16 |but you see , over time| WMl53FV052U
_*44602 10:17 |elders began meeting together to discuss problems| WMl53FV052U
_*44603 10:21 |relating to the various congregations .| WMl53FV052U
_*44604 10:24 |when you get to the 300s a.d. the roman emperor constantine| WMl53FV052U
_*44605 10:28 |was starting to have interest in this growing group of people| WMl53FV052U
_*44606 10:30 |known as the church of christ .| WMl53FV052U
_*44607 10:32 |in a.d. 313| WMl53FV052U
_*44608 10:34 |he passed the edict of milan| WMl53FV052U
_*44609 10:37 |which ended the persecution against christians .| WMl53FV052U
_*44610 10:40 |and you can imagine this gained in favor with christians| WMl53FV052U
_*44611 10:42 |in and around rome .| WMl53FV052U
_*44612 10:44 |and so the roman government began gaining a lot of influence| WMl53FV052U
_*44613 10:48 |with elders in the church of christ| WMl53FV052U
_*44614 10:50 |and the end result was a very adverse effect| WMl53FV052U
_*44615 10:53 |on a large portion of christ 's church .| WMl53FV052U
_*44616 10:55 |you see this new relationship| WMl53FV052U
_*44617 10:57 |led to a meeting| WMl53FV052U
_*44618 10:58 |between elders in the church of christ and roman officials .| WMl53FV052U
_*44619 11:01 |this meeting took place| WMl53FV052U
_*44620 11:03 |in a.d. 325| WMl53FV052U
_*44621 11:05 |and history calls this event| WMl53FV052U
_*44622 11:07 |the council of nicea .| WMl53FV052U
_*44623 11:09 |this meeting gave rise to| WMl53FV052U
_*44624 11:11 |the first officially recognized departure| WMl53FV052U
_*44625 11:14 |from the original new testament church| WMl53FV052U
_*44626 11:16 |now , this newly created denomination| WMl53FV052U
_*44627 11:18 |took a latin word ; catholic| WMl53FV052U
_*44628 11:20 |which is translated ; universal| WMl53FV052U
_*44629 11:22 |and established a hierarchy| WMl53FV052U
_*44630 11:24 |very similar to that of the roman government .| WMl53FV052U
_*44631 11:27 |they literally took the example of the roman government| WMl53FV052U
_*44632 11:30 |and built a church that was based on that model| WMl53FV052U
_*44633 11:34 |and so in this new church| WMl53FV052U
_*44634 11:36 |there were men who were over several churches| WMl53FV052U
_*44635 11:39 |or groups of churches| WMl53FV052U
_*44636 11:40 |which was a very clear departure from the new testament pattern .| WMl53FV052U
_*44637 11:44 |now , christians who were faithful to the bible ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44638 11:47 |those who stood against this newly created catholic denomination ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44639 11:51 |they were persecuted and ostracized .| WMl53FV052U
_*44640 11:54 |they had to meet in hiding .| WMl53FV052U
_*44641 11:56 |but the pure new testament church of christ| WMl53FV052U
_*44642 11:59 |continued to exist .| WMl53FV052U
_*44643 12:01 |now , historically speaking| WMl53FV052U
_*44644 12:03 |after the formation and establishment of this catholic church ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44645 12:06 |it grew in strength and number and political power| WMl53FV052U
_*44646 12:10 |they created new doctrines and man-made traditions and| WMl53FV052U
_*44647 12:14 |they enjoyed growing political endorsements from the roman government .| WMl53FV052U
_*44648 12:19 |in time their doctrines were made| WMl53FV052U
_*44649 12:21 |mandates and required of all of the members of the catholic church .| WMl53FV052U
_*44650 12:25 |notice the dates on the chart| WMl53FV052U
_*44651 12:27 |as the catholic church implemented| WMl53FV052U
_*44652 12:28 |some of these doctrines| WMl53FV052U
_*44653 12:30 |long after the formation of their denomination .| WMl53FV052U
_*44654 12:33 |there was ; latin mass , purgatory ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44655 12:37 |the first official pope , they called him `` god on earth '' .| WMl53FV052U
_*44656 12:42 transubstantiation WMl53FV052U
_*44657 12:43 |the mandate of the celibacy of the priest in 1015| WMl53FV052U
_*44658 12:47 |now , if you will look at the timeline| WMl53FV052U
_*44659 12:49 |you will see that| WMl53FV052U
_*44660 12:50 |for the first thousand years| WMl53FV052U
_*44661 12:51 |there was really only two churches .| WMl53FV052U
_*44662 12:54 |you had the church of christ| WMl53FV052U
_*44663 12:56 |that began on the day of pentecost in jerusalem| WMl53FV052U
_*44664 12:58 |that still existed .| WMl53FV052U
_*44665 13:00 |and then there was catholicism| WMl53FV052U
_*44666 13:01 |now , history tells us that in 1054| WMl53FV052U
_*44667 13:05 |the catholic church split into two denominations| WMl53FV052U
_*44668 13:08 |you had roman catholicism| WMl53FV052U
_*44669 13:10 |and the greek orthodox church .| WMl53FV052U
_*44670 13:12 |now , during this time the bible became more and more unavailable| WMl53FV052U
_*44671 13:17 |to the common man .| WMl53FV052U
_*44672 13:18 |and this period became known as the dark ages| WMl53FV052U
_*44673 13:21 |and the catholic church just continued to add man-made doctrines .| WMl53FV052U
_*44674 13:26 |examples include ;| WMl53FV052U
_*44675 13:28 |indulgences in 1192| WMl53FV052U
_*44676 13:30 |the `` confessional booth '' in 1215| WMl53FV052U
_*44677 13:32 |sprinkling replaced immersion for baptism in 1311| WMl53FV052U
_*44678 13:36 |and the pope was declared infallible .| WMl53FV052U
_*44679 13:39 |now , by the time you get to the 1500 's| WMl53FV052U
_*44680 13:42 |you will see a lot of activity on the timeline .| WMl53FV052U
_*44681 13:45 |this is because| WMl53FV052U
_*44682 13:46 |there were men such as martin luther| WMl53FV052U
_*44683 13:48 |who began to stand up and say `` this is not right ! ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44684 13:52 |martin luther was a german monk| WMl53FV052U
_*44685 13:54 |and he hated the selling of indulgences .| WMl53FV052U
_*44686 13:57 |he challenged the pope| WMl53FV052U
_*44687 13:58 |saying `` the bible is only source of authority . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44688 14:02 |martin luther 's widespread opposition| WMl53FV052U
_*44689 14:04 |to the catholic church ignited a protest movement| WMl53FV052U
_*44690 14:08 |which is historically known as the protestant reformation .| WMl53FV052U
_*44691 14:11 |in 1521 ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44692 14:13 |another denomination appeared shortly before| WMl53FV052U
_*44693 14:16 |the lutheran church came on the scene ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44694 14:18 |it was known as the anabaptists .| WMl53FV052U
_*44695 14:20 |they started as a protest against the catholic church| WMl53FV052U
_*44696 14:23 |and its practice of infant baptism .| WMl53FV052U
_*44697 14:26 |`` ana '' means again| WMl53FV052U
_*44698 14:27 |they baptized again those who had been baptized as babies| WMl53FV052U
_*44699 14:32 |in the catholic church .| WMl53FV052U
_*44700 14:33 |but what is really interesting ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44701 14:35 |is that the anabaptist movement| WMl53FV052U
_*44702 14:37 |spawned several other churches ;| WMl53FV052U
_*44703 14:39 |to include the baptist , the amish , the mennonites ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44704 14:43 |and brethren in christ .| WMl53FV052U
_*44705 14:45 |and as religious freedom expanded| WMl53FV052U
_*44706 14:48 |denominationalism continued to grow| WMl53FV052U
_*44707 14:50 |and to multiply into dozens of factions| WMl53FV052U
_*44708 14:53 |and you can see that on the timeline .| WMl53FV052U
_*44709 14:55 |and this laid the foundation for a multitude of denominations| WMl53FV052U
_*44710 14:59 |that exist in our present day .| WMl53FV052U
_*44711 15:01 |some of these churches began with a noble desire| WMl53FV052U
_*44712 15:05 |to break free from some clearly unscriptural practices .| WMl53FV052U
_*44713 15:09 |others began with less than noble reasoning .| WMl53FV052U
_*44714 15:11 |you will notice on the chart| WMl53FV052U
_*44715 15:13 |that the church of england started in 1534 .| WMl53FV052U
_*44716 15:15 |this church began after henry viii 's| WMl53FV052U
_*44717 15:19 |desire to have his marriage to katherine of aragon annulled .| WMl53FV052U
_*44718 15:23 |when the roman catholic church would not grant his annulment ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44719 15:27 |the result was the separation from the catholic church| WMl53FV052U
_*44720 15:30 |and the formation of a new church ;| WMl53FV052U
_*44721 15:33 |the church of england .| WMl53FV052U
_*44722 15:34 |well , what is the point of all of that ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44723 15:36 |the point is ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44724 15:37 |if you look at the chart , the timeline ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44725 15:39 |it represents just a small fraction of churches that exist today .| WMl53FV052U
_*44726 15:44 |some began with good motives and others began with bad motives ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44727 15:47 |but all of them were started by men .| WMl53FV052U
_*44728 15:51 |now , if you will go back to the top of the chart| WMl53FV052U
_*44729 15:53 |you will see the green line that represents the church| WMl53FV052U
_*44730 15:56 |started by jesus christ .| WMl53FV052U
_*44731 15:58 |this is the church that began in a.d. 33| WMl53FV052U
_*44732 16:01 |in jerusalem .| WMl53FV052U
_*44733 16:02 |it is the church of christ| WMl53FV052U
_*44734 16:04 |the one we read about in the pages of the new testament .| WMl53FV052U
_*44735 16:07 |and from history , we see that all other churches| WMl53FV052U
_*44736 16:10 |were man-made denominations .| WMl53FV052U
_*44737 16:13 |hopefully now ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44738 16:15 |you can see why there are so many churches .| WMl53FV052U
_*44739 16:17 |and here is the message| WMl53FV052U
_*44740 16:18 |that we really need to take to heart ;| WMl53FV052U
_*44741 16:20 |since jesus condemns division ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44742 16:23 |we need to be a part of that one church| WMl53FV052U
_*44743 16:26 |that jesus established .| WMl53FV052U
_*44744 16:28 |the one that he bought with his blood .| WMl53FV052U
_*44745 16:30 |not one of the man-made churches| WMl53FV052U
_*44746 16:33 |that came along later in history .| WMl53FV052U
_*44747 16:36 |now , what does all this mean for us today ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44748 16:38 |does this mean that denominations are wrong ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44749 16:41 |dear friend , we want to be kind but we want to be clear .| WMl53FV052U
_*44750 16:45 |and the answer is ...| WMl53FV052U
_*44751 16:47 |yes , it would have to mean that .| WMl53FV052U
_*44752 16:49 |all churches other than the one built by jesus christ| WMl53FV052U
_*44753 16:53 |exist without new testament authority or example .| WMl53FV052U
_*44754 16:58 |now somebody says , `` does that mean that| WMl53FV052U
_*44755 17:00 |good intentioned morally upright people| WMl53FV052U
_*44756 17:02 |in denominations will be lost ? ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44757 17:05 |well , let 's let the lord answer this question ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44758 17:07 |i want you to listent to the words of jesus in mattew 7:21-23 :| WMl53FV052U
_*44759 17:11 |`` not everyone who says to me ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44760 17:13 |`` lord , lord , ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44761 17:14 |shall enter the kingdom of heaven| WMl53FV052U
_*44762 17:16 |but he who does the will of my father in heaven .| WMl53FV052U
_*44763 17:19 |many will say unto me in that day ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44764 17:21 |`` lord , lord ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44765 17:23 |have we not prophesied in your name ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44766 17:25 |cast out demons in your name ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44767 17:27 |and done many wonders in your name ? ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44768 17:30 |and i will declare to them ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44769 17:32 |`` i never knew you ;| WMl53FV052U
_*44770 17:34 |depart from me ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44771 17:35 |you who practice lawlessness ! ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44772 17:39 |dear friend , observe with me that jesus says ;| WMl53FV052U
_*44773 17:42 |that on the day of judgement| WMl53FV052U
_*44774 17:43 |there will be good people ;| WMl53FV052U
_*44775 17:45 |people who are teachers ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44776 17:47 |people who claim to hold to the name of jesus ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44777 17:49 |people who will be lost| WMl53FV052U
_*44778 17:51 |because they have n't done the will of the father .| WMl53FV052U
_*44779 17:54 |now , the point is ;| WMl53FV052U
_*44780 17:56 |having good intentions is not enough .| WMl53FV052U
_*44781 17:59 |having my heart right is not enough .| WMl53FV052U
_*44782 18:01 |i actually have to follow the new testament pattern .| WMl53FV052U
_*44783 18:04 |i want you to listen again to the words of acts 2:47| WMl53FV052U
_*44784 18:08 |`` ... praising god and having favor with all the people .| WMl53FV052U
_*44785 18:11 |the lord added to the church| WMl53FV052U
_*44786 18:14 |daily those who were being saved . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44787 18:17 |friend , all of the saved people are in the church .| WMl53FV052U
_*44788 18:21 |that one built by jesus .| WMl53FV052U
_*44789 18:23 |the same one that existed in acts chapter two .| WMl53FV052U
_*44790 18:26 |the same one that we read about throughout the new testament .| WMl53FV052U
_*44791 18:29 |the one that existed prior to all the denominations of man .| WMl53FV052U
_*44792 18:35 |now , the question is ;| WMl53FV052U
_*44793 18:36 |how do i become a part of that church ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44794 18:39 |the one wherein is salvation .| WMl53FV052U
_*44795 18:42 |how do i become a part of the one church| WMl53FV052U
_*44796 18:44 |of the new testament ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44797 18:46 |and the answer is ...| WMl53FV052U
_*44798 18:47 |the same way they did it in the new testament .| WMl53FV052U
_*44799 18:50 |you 've got to obey the gospel .| WMl53FV052U
_*44800 18:52 |you know sometimes people in the religious world| WMl53FV052U
_*44801 18:54 |will tell you that `` there is nothing you have to obey . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44802 18:58 |they will say that `` you only need to believe . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44803 19:00 |but i want you to listen to the words| WMl53FV052U
_*44804 19:02 |of second thessalonians chapter one verses 7 and 8| WMl53FV052U
_*44805 19:05 |the bible says ;| WMl53FV052U
_*44806 19:06 |`` and to give you who are troubled rest| WMl53FV052U
_*44807 19:09 |with us| WMl53FV052U
_*44808 19:09 |when the lord jesus is revealed from heaven| WMl53FV052U
_*44809 19:12 |with his mighty angels , ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44810 19:14 |now listen to this he is describing the day of judgement .| WMl53FV052U
_*44811 19:16 |he says that some people are going to receive rest ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44812 19:19 |some people are going to receive punishment .| WMl53FV052U
_*44813 19:21 |he says `` when the lord comes in flaming fire| WMl53FV052U
_*44814 19:24 |taking vengeance on those| WMl53FV052U
_*44815 19:26 |who do not know god , ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44816 19:28 |now listen .| WMl53FV052U
_*44817 19:29 |and on those who do not obey the gospel| WMl53FV052U
_*44818 19:32 |of our lord jesus christ .| WMl53FV052U
_*44819 19:34 |your see , we must obey the gospel| WMl53FV052U
_*44820 19:36 |now , obeying the gospel| WMl53FV052U
_*44821 19:38 |can be summed up| WMl53FV052U
_*44822 19:39 |in five short words .| WMl53FV052U
_*44823 19:40 hear WMl53FV052U
_*44824 19:42 believe WMl53FV052U
_*44825 19:42 repent WMl53FV052U
_*44826 19:44 confess WMl53FV052U
_*44827 19:44 |and baptism| WMl53FV052U
_*44828 19:46 |now , somebody says `` what does that mean , explain that ? ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44829 19:48 |well first , a man must hear the gospel .| WMl53FV052U
_*44830 19:51 |he hears that because of his sin| WMl53FV052U
_*44831 19:54 |he has transgressed the will of god| WMl53FV052U
_*44832 19:56 |and is destined to die eternally in hell . '' romans 6:23| WMl53FV052U
_*44833 20:00 |`` the wages of sin is death , ''| WMl53FV052U

_*44859 20:56 |he must of course believe in the death , burial and resurrection of christ .| WMl53FV052U
_*44860 21:01 |how it is that| WMl53FV052U
_*44861 21:02 |`` while we were yet sinners ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44862 21:04 |christ died for us . '' romans 5:8| WMl53FV052U

_*44870 21:21 |you will be saved . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44871 21:23 |of course , it is crucial it is crucial| WMl53FV052U

_*44878 21:41 |`` truly these times of ignorance god overlooked ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44879 21:44 |but now commands all men| WMl53FV052U
_*44880 21:47 |everywhere to repent . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44881 21:50 |repentance is a change of mind| WMl53FV052U
_*44882 21:53 |brought about by godly sorrow| WMl53FV052U
_*44883 21:56 |that results in a reformation of life .| WMl53FV052U
_*44884 21:59 |that is important to understand .| WMl53FV052U
_*44885 22:00 |sometimes peopl will say ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44886 22:01 |`` repentance is merely changing your life . ''| WMl53FV052U

_*44889 22:08 |of course , that is followed by a change of life .| WMl53FV052U
_*44890 22:11 |but then , step number four ;| WMl53FV052U
_*44891 22:12 |a person must confess his faith in christ .| WMl53FV052U
_*44892 22:15 |romans 10 and verse 10| WMl53FV052U

_*44897 22:25 |in acts chapter 8| WMl53FV052U
_*44898 22:27 |as philip was teaching the gospel to the ethiopian ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44899 22:30 |he said , `` see here is water .| WMl53FV052U
_*44900 22:33 |what hinders me from being baptized ? ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44901 22:35 |philip responded to the ethiopian and said ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44902 22:37 |`` if you believe with all of your heart , you may . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44903 22:40 |and he answered and said ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44904 22:42 |`` i believe jesus christ is the son of god . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44905 22:46 |that is the confession we are talking about .| WMl53FV052U
_*44906 22:47 |not a confession of our sin .| WMl53FV052U
_*44907 22:49 |a confession of what we have heard and what we believe .| WMl53FV052U
_*44908 22:52 |it is an acknowledgement .| WMl53FV052U
_*44909 22:53 |`` yes , we believe these things . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44910 22:55 |now finally ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44911 22:57 |involved in obeying the gospel| WMl53FV052U
_*44912 22:58 |one must be baptized .| WMl53FV052U
_*44913 23:00 |in mark 16 and verse 16 jesus said ;| WMl53FV052U
_*44914 23:04 |`` he who believes and is baptized| WMl53FV052U
_*44915 23:05 |will be saved ;| WMl53FV052U
_*44916 23:07 |but he who does not believe| WMl53FV052U
_*44917 23:09 |will be condemned . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44918 23:11 |you know , baptism as practiced by first century christians| WMl53FV052U
_*44919 23:15 |was total immersion .| WMl53FV052U
_*44920 23:16 |in fact that is the meaning of baptism .| WMl53FV052U
_*44921 23:18 |it is the point| WMl53FV052U
_*44922 23:20 |at which a person| WMl53FV052U
_*44923 23:21 |is immersed in water| WMl53FV052U
_*44924 23:22 |and the point at which he contacts the saving blood of jesus .| WMl53FV052U
_*44925 23:26 |it is the point at which he has finally obeyed the gospel .| WMl53FV052U
_*44926 23:29 |romans 6:3 and 4 says ;| WMl53FV052U
_*44927 23:32 |`` or do you not know| WMl53FV052U
_*44928 23:34 |that as many of us as were baptized| WMl53FV052U
_*44929 23:37 |into christ jesus| WMl53FV052U
_*44930 23:38 |were baptized into his death ?| WMl53FV052U
_*44931 23:41 |therefore we were buried with him| WMl53FV052U
_*44932 23:43 |through baptism into death , that just as christ| WMl53FV052U
_*44933 23:46 |was raised from the dead by the glory of the father ,| WMl53FV052U
_*44934 23:48 |even so we also should walk in newness of life . ''| WMl53FV052U
_*44935 23:53 |and so , we are buried in the watery grave of baptism| WMl53FV052U
_*44936 23:56 |jesus shed his blood in his death .| WMl53FV052U
_*44937 23:59 |in baptism we are buried into his death .| WMl53FV052U
_*44938 24:02 |we contact that saving blood of christ| WMl53FV052U
_*44939 24:04 |and our sins are washed away .| WMl53FV052U
_*44940 24:07 |that 's why we come out of that watery grave of baptism| WMl53FV052U
_*44941 24:11 |to walk in newness of life .| WMl53FV052U
_*44942 24:13 |once you have done those things .| WMl53FV052U
_*44943 24:14 |acts 2:47 says| WMl53FV052U

_*45766 0:33 |and there are explanations there for anything you may find confusing .| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45767 0:39 |the point of this song is to have a bit of fun and to introduce to you a bit about british| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45768 0:47 |english and british culture , so please read those lyrics if you want to , if that helps .| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45769 0:59 |i 'm going to play it now and i hope you like it . it 's a song i wrote , it 's called :| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45770 1:03 |`` british english song '' ( lyrics and music by chris workman )| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45771 1:43 |welcome to my british english song . i might get some words wrong because| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45772 1:48 |this language ai n't easy at all ,| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45773 1:51 |practising is the most powerful tool .| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45774 1:55 |our vowels are a , e , i , o and u , ( question : ) which consonant can be a vowel too ?| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45775 2:02 |write `` i '' before `` e '' except after `` c '' .| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45776 2:12 |but who cares if you only want to understand me ?| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45777 2:14 |the uk is a very crazy place we always complain with a polite face .| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45778 2:21 |i 'm from the south so when i talk i might confuse someone from the north .| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45779 2:32 |british jokes can seem unfunny and sad , that 's because our sense of humour 's mad .| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45780 2:41 |if you think it 's strange we drink so much tea| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45781 2:44 |i love it a lot so please do n't tell me .| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45782 2:55 |you ask why you have to work to learn just to speak to some stupid briton .| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45783 3:11 |you wonder : `` why do n't they learn to speak to me ? ''| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45784 3:17 |well i 'm english and ( to be honest ) i 'm too lazy .| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45785 3:23 |you study grammar at home and at school but `` there 's an exception to every rule '' .| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45786 3:33 |we say , `` that 's life , '' when it 's not easy ,| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45787 3:37 |or we steal french and say , `` c'est la vie '' !| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45788 3:46 |a language is never learnt quickly , never `` as easy as 1 , 2 , 3 '' .| uLw7JnU5rSE
_*45789 3:51 |but working hard is all you have to do . so good luck and i hope for the best for you .| uLw7JnU5rSE

_*46059 9:02 sacrifice MY9c5y5Wgws
_*46060 9:03 |that would be made later a sacrifice to god himself would make| MY9c5y5Wgws

_*46062 9:14 |as the sacrifice for their sins| MY9c5y5Wgws
_*46063 9:18 |god was planning to send jesus into the world| MY9c5y5Wgws
_*46064 9:21 |to become the sacrifice for the sins of all people| MY9c5y5Wgws
_*46065 9:25 |god told us to several others profits| MY9c5y5Wgws

_*46121 3:19 |should get to leave the hospital really soon well good that 's a relief| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46122 3:23 |i 'm wondering as her dorm counselor| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46123 3:26 |i think we should all put our heads together and figure out the best ways to| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46124 3:30 |support her| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46125 3:30 |will need to learn what her checkers are in| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46126 3:34 |knowing a check is gon na be really important triggers| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46127 3:39 |resent me so that 's the sign for| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46128 3:43 |triggers am it means the different kinds of things that can cause a person with| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46129 3:48 |asma to have an asthma attack| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46130 3:50 |we call those things triggers her| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46131 3:56 |you seem to know a lot about asthma well| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46132 3:59 |my father has asma so i saw what it was like for him| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46133 4:03 |you know it 's interesting he has lots of different kinds that triggers| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46134 4:07 |one was our family dog i know you might think that 's kinda been add one but| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46135 4:12 |actually cats and dogs have dry skin that can flake off| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46136 4:17 |and if a person with asthma read them that dander| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46137 4:21 |it can cause an asthma attack policy had to give up your dog| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46138 4:25 |are no no no we just have to be careful| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46139 4:29 |and do special things to keep the dog in the house clean| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46140 4:32 |it 's really no problem we just have to give the dog a bath every weekend keeper| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46141 4:36 |outside more often| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46142 4:37 |in the house we have to vacuum and map every week| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46143 4:42 |and the dog can sleep in my parents bad anymore because| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46144 4:46 |like i said the dander from the dog could get on the bed| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46145 4:49 |and then my father would inhaler| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46146 4:53 |and he 'd end up having a really hard time breathing so we ca n't do that| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46147 4:56 anymore n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46148 4:57 |does your father have to use an inhaler| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46149 5:00 |oh yeah he does he has one to use when he feels the warning signs a minute| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46150 5:07 |asthma attack| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46151 5:07 |it 's just for emergency use| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46152 5:11 |but he also takes medication every day to prevent| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46153 5:15 |asthma attacks and is how to spend great really| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46154 5:18 |asthma medicines and the plans for people are all different| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46155 5:22 |each person has their own asthma management plan| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46156 5:26 |but they make up with their doctor and if chris is diagnosed with asthma| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46157 5:30 |will have to know what her triggers i well if she 's diagnosed with asthma and| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46158 5:34 |i should do a special health class on the topic at the asthma| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46159 5:37 |so the kids to understand about chris 's needs and be prepared| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46160 5:40 |for what to do the supporter yeah that 's a good idea| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46161 5:44 |you know i just remember that the cdc website has a lot of good information| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46162 5:49 |you could use for that class| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46163 5:51 |well that 's helpful okay| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46164 5:54 |that i look into that great hasty| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46165 6:00 |did you hear that chris was officially diagnosed with asthma| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46166 6:08 |yes i did i 've been researching the topic at the asthma for my health class| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46167 6:13 |has is really serious| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46168 6:16 |it 's interesting there 's no real cure for asthma| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46169 6:19 |even the causes are unknown| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46170 6:24 |well that 's what i found from my readings hmm i now| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46171 6:28 |hey what 's not on the desk it 's a straw| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46172 6:31 |i thought it would be a perfect way to explain what it 's like| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46173 6:34 |to breathe when your lungs are affected with the asthma| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46174 6:38 |distrusted the comparison hmm how 's that| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46175 6:43 |all this is perfect if you do n't mind let me show you how i plan to use this| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46176 6:47 |tried to explain this to the class| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46177 6:50 |sure go ahead k| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46178 6:54 |normally a healthy person is able to get lots of air into and out of their lungs| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46179 6:58 easily n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46180 6:59 |readings comfortable but if a person has asthma| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46181 7:02 |it 's like trying to breathe in and out through a straw| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46182 7:05 |you can still breathe in general but the air flows restricted| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46183 7:09 |now during an asthma attack reading would be like trying to get your through| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46184 7:14 |this trial| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46185 7:14 |when i 'm squeezing it until it 's almost closed beings really hard| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46186 7:19 |guess what it 's like when the air passages in a person 's lungs are| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46187 7:22 |constricted and an asthma attack| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46188 7:25 |do you think the explanation would be cleared students oh yeah that 's really| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46189 7:29 clear n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46190 7:30 |maybe you could also add in an explanation about inhalers| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46191 7:33 |and how the medicine and then helped to expand the air passages in the person 's| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46192 7:38 |lines to make breathing easier| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46193 7:42 |perfect are used that idea and my explanation in the class| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46194 7:46 |we should also call a meeting of all the dorm supervisors| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46195 7:49 |to make sure they understand chris 's triggers in her asthma management plan| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46196 7:54 |so that we all can be as supportive as possible| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46197 7:58 |is a look through the cdc website it really stresses the importance of| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46198 8:03 understanding n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46199 8:03 |the environmental triggers in order to reduce| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46200 8:07 |we can prevent asthma attacks| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46201 8:11 |good idea out talk with amanda and we 'll plan that meeting| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46202 8:20 |thank you all for coming to the special meeting i really appreciate it| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46203 8:25 |we wanted to inform all the dorm councils about something important| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46204 8:29 |now you all remember chris wright well| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46205 8:32 |she 's been diagnosed with asthma| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46206 8:36 |now as you know chris lives here in the dorm during the week| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46207 8:39 |and goes home on the weekends what we need to do is figure out what triggers| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46208 8:45 |lead her to have breathing problems and then work to remove them| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46209 8:53 |i print out this information from the cdc website for you| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46210 8:57 |have you had a chance to read it yesterday| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46211 9:01 |yahoo oh yeah create| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46212 9:05 |i want to discuss a number of different points because it 's so important that we| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46213 9:08 |reduce chris is exposure to her| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46214 9:10 |asthma triggers the most important trigger at the top of the list| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46215 9:14 |is inhaling cigarette smoke fortunate school smoking is not allowed| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46216 9:18 |so that will be a problem| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46217 9:22 |what about when she 's home has anyone spoke there| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46218 9:25 |good question i already talk to their parents about this and explain| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46219 9:29 |their friends and family should not smoke in the car or in the home| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46220 9:33 |especially when chris is there yes i was very rare| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46221 9:36 |okay another possible triggers are on the cc list| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46222 9:41 |well the website mention mold as a really important one| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46223 9:46 |and you know like in a damp room well| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46224 9:49 |i 'll i have a good example you know how a shower curtain can get those little| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46225 9:53 |black spots on| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46226 9:55 |well thats mold and if a person with asma breeze| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46227 9:58 |that n it can cause an asthma attack that interesting| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46228 10:04 |you know i think asked the facilities manager if he would n't mind inspecting| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46229 10:07 |the dorms in the classrooms to make sure there 's no mold around| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46230 10:12 |but it 's going to take some time to do that since mold| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46231 10:15 |can grow behind wall| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46232 10:18 |you know those pipes that are hidden behind the walls| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46233 10:22 |and they might have little water leaks and mold could grow in their| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46234 10:27 |so it might be a while before the inspection is done| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46235 10:32 |maybe we should check the humidity levels in the air to prevent mold from| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46236 10:36 growing n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46237 10:39 |if the air is damp it could cause mold to grow and spread| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46238 10:44 |that 's the cdc recommend what air humidity levels should be| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46239 10:51 |well it says here that the cdc recommends the humidity be fifty percent| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46240 10:55 |or less to prevent mold growth| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46241 10:59 |i can also ask facilities to measure the air humidity levels| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46242 11:03 |and if they are above fifty percent they can bring in a dehumidifier| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46243 11:08 |what is he just spelled i did n't understand| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46244 11:12 |i 'll i meant a dehumidifier| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46245 11:16 |i 'll the machine that removes moisture from the air| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46246 11:20 |yeah exactly now thanks for talking to facilities about that yes nikki| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46247 11:25 |well i just read on the web said about dust mites know the tiny little bugs| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46248 11:29 |that you can even see| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46249 11:30 |it says dust mites live everywhere but they 're especially common| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46250 11:35 |unmatched really most people are n't bothered by dust mites the song credibly| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46251 11:41 tiny n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46252 11:42 |but per person who has asthma dust mites can be a trigger for an asthma attack| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46253 11:47 |so i can call the house cleaning staff and ask them to get| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46254 11:51 |mattress cover to prevent exposure to dust mites what do you think| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46255 11:54 |cad also chris 's parents| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46256 11:58 |sent a special pillow cases to use we 're gon na have to get ready for| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46257 12:02 |old tell us because those pillows are n't filled with| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46258 12:07 |down you know which tends to attract dust mites| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46259 12:10 |so we have to get rid of them great i appreciate those comments very helpful| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46260 12:15 |now last on the list your cock roaches you know those buns a scurry across the| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46261 12:20 floor n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46262 12:21 |here yeah back cockroaches| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46263 12:25 |we do n't have cockroaches here we have an exterminator who comes by| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46264 12:30 |regularly to spray chemicals to kill bugs i know but still| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46265 12:35 |if the kids eat food and drop crumbs or leave their drinks lying around| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46266 12:39 |well the bugs will be attracted to that really| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46267 12:44 |we 'll just have to be even more careful to keep things clean| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46268 12:49 |we can ask the house cleaning staff to vacuum more often| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46269 12:52 |maybe every two to three days thank you i really appreciate you are coming| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46270 12:58 |great now just to let you know chris will be back in a few days| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46271 13:02 |perfect i wan na make sure we are ready for her before she writes| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46272 13:05 |okay write wonderful by so| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46273 13:10 |i saw you bring in all your new things pillows and bed covers| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46274 13:13 |what else did you doctor have to say about what you should do| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46275 13:17 |i have to learn my triggers are so i can avoid those things| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46276 13:22 |if something happens and i have trouble breathing| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46277 13:26 |all know what to do to control it each individual with asthma has different| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46278 13:32 triggers n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46279 13:33 |light good| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46280 13:36 |so when you start to notice that you 're having a little trouble breathing| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46281 13:40 |that 's a warning that helps you learn what your triggers i| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46282 13:43 |it 's very important to pay attention to your triggers| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46283 13:46 |things like dust cold air pat 's| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46284 13:49 |smoke there are quite a few possibilities| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46285 13:52 |and you need to pay a lot of attention to figure out what your particular| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46286 13:56 |triggers are| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46287 13:57 |really important right my doctor and i developed a plan| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46288 14:03 |so that if my breathing becomes difficult all know what to do| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46289 14:08 |and how to control their asthma good so what is your specific plan| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46290 14:13 |oh yeah i first have to take these pills every day| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46291 14:29 |and if i start to have trouble breathing i had this entailed ready for that some| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46292 14:36 people n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46293 14:37 |have an inhaler that they use every day but i do n't have to do that| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46294 14:40 great n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46295 14:44 |that 's great you 're going to be just fine| n4IZEaDsfv8
_*46296 0:02 |hi .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46297 0:02 |this is the video for module 10 .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46298 0:06 |the topic is model programs .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46299 0:08 |if i were to ask you each of you what came to mind when you thought about deaf ed . program ,| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46300 0:16 |i 'm sure we would have such a variety of answers , just depending on each of your specific| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46301 0:23 |experiences .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46302 0:26 |there has always been a variety of ideas as to how we should educate deaf students .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46303 0:35 |you 're already familiar with the continuum of placements - which range from fully mainstreamed| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46304 0:44 |to attendance at the school for the deaf . and then we also have the continuum of communication| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46305 0:50 |methodologies , which range from full oral -- so sign , to fully asl -- no voice .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46306 1:00 |in the history deaf education , we have gone back and forth on those continuums several| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46307 1:08 |times .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46308 1:09 |now finally , the general acceptance is moving towards individualizing for students and being| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46309 1:19 |open to using a variety of methodologies within the classroom or program .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46310 1:28 |really quick , i want to talk about sim-com and total-communication .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46311 1:34 |those two terms are used a lot , and often interchangeably , but there is a difference| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46312 1:40 |and i want to clarify really quick .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46313 1:43 |simultaneous-communication , or sim-com , is what i 'm doing right now .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46314 1:48 |it means signing everything and voicing everything .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46315 1:52 |not going to talk about the concerns with that right now , but that is what that refers| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46316 1:58 |to .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46317 1:59 |total-communication means using any and all methods needed to communicate with that student .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46318 2:10 |it could include sim-com , but it 's not necessarily always signing and talking ,| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46319 2:17 |it could mean writing back and forth .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46320 2:21 |it could mean using full asl for content classes and using signed english for english class ,| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46321 2:28 |just whatever is needed for that student in that moment .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46322 2:32 |okay , so i just wanted to clarify that , now back on track .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46323 2:39 |it 's really important to remember that it 's not the student 's responsibility to fit| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46324 2:46 |into a program that is set-up . it 's the school 's responsibility to develop a program| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46325 2:55 |for that student .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46326 2:57 |with that said , i understand the realities , especially for rural areas , you know resources| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46327 3:09 |are limited , and sometimes that does n't happen .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46328 3:12 |but , what i want you to keep in mind about that -- is if you have responsibilities or| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46329 3:19 |capability to change programs , or have some say in how programs are implemented , keep| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46330 3:30 |that in mind .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46331 3:31 |a student does n't have to be fully mainstreamed all day .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46332 3:35 |they do n't have to be self-contained all day .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46333 3:38 |they may need to go back and forth .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46334 3:41 |and then , even deeper than that , you may have a student who needs to go to deaf ed . for| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46335 3:50 |some classes , and needs to go to a more specialized classroom for other subjects .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46336 4:03 |within deaf ed. , we have a high number of students who have additional issues .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46337 4:09 |they could be physical issues , attention issues , learning struggles -- maybe it 's a diagnosed| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46338 4:16 |learning disability , maybe it 's not .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46339 4:18 |maybe , a lot of times , we do n't know if it is or not .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46340 4:24 |in those situations , it 's really easy to get stressed out about the label , and think ,| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46341 4:31 |i 'm not a qualified special ed . teacher , or that student 's primary disability is n't| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46342 4:40 |deafness .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46343 4:40 |they should be in another class ...| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46344 4:43 |i really want you to remember that 's not what 's most important .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46345 4:48 |what 's most important is where is that student going to thrive the most ?| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46346 4:56 |i have had students whose primary disability was n't deafness , it truly was n't .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46347 5:03 |but , looking at the whole situation , the iep team felt they would be best served in the| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46348 5:10 |deaf ed . class , and that 's where they went .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46349 5:12 |and there 's nothing wrong with that , as long as everyone is on the same page about| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46350 5:19 |the situation .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46351 5:20 |so , that 's it .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46352 5:25 |just remember , do n't be afraid to customize programs .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46353 5:29 |do n't be afraid to make suggestions and make changes if things are not working .| CjNCKIP55_4
_*46354 0:01 |okay i 'm going to sing and sign| 6t8lm2BjN4s

_*46748 0:01 |hello !| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46749 0:03 |i 'm doing a vlog on the earthquake here in dc yesterday .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46750 0:10 |i will be covering three things in my vlog : a history of seismic activity in virginia ,| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46751 0:19 |the differences between the west coast and the east coast when it comes to earthquakes ,| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46752 0:25 |and what to do the next time an earthquake strikes .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46753 0:31 |but first i know you probably are curious about my experience| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46754 0:36 |during the earthquake yesterday so i 'll go into that first .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46755 0:41 |it goes without saying , the tremor was felt across the majority of the east coast , registering a 5.8 , at 1:51pm .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46756 0:54 |i was at work , sitting in a room and watching someone delivering a presentation .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46757 1:03 |all of a sudden , i had a very strange feeling .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46758 1:06 |i did n't feel the ground moving , but still a strange sensation nonetheless .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46759 1:09 |i felt the gravitation of my body suddenly changing .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46760 1:13 |i was n't sure if the ground was moving as i felt the tug of the gravitation against my body .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46761 1:17 |it felt like the ground was slowly sliding in a forward-backward motion , a swaying sensation .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46762 1:22 |i thought it was just my imagination and pressed on in watching the presentation .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46763 1:28 |the strength of the shaking increased and i kept on asking myself if i was imagining it .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46764 1:37 |then it shook at its strongest and i realized it was actually an earthquake .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46765 1:44 |i immediately got off my chair and got on my knees on the floor , getting ready to duck under the table .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46766 1:52 |then the shaking stopped and i was still kneeling .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46767 1:59 |everything was so quiet and everyone was looking at each other .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46768 2:04 |many of the other people was still wondering and confused about what just happened .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46769 2:09 |i already immediately knew it was an earthquake .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46770 2:12 |i have never experienced an earthquake before and it was my first time .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46771 2:14 |yet , i knew .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46772 2:21 |eventually , everyone had to evacuate the building .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46773 2:28 |i did wondered why everyone else did n't dive for the cover of the tables .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46774 2:35 |i was actually off my chair , kneeling and looking over the table at everyone else .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46775 2:41 |they just stayed in their positions , completely transfixed .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46776 2:43 |i did n't go under the table because i did n't want to look foolish being the only one under a table !| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46777 2:48 |it was clear that people here on the east coast were n't trained for this kind of situation .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46778 2:58 |earthquakes of this magnitude here in the east are extremely rare .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46779 3:04 |so people naturally were disoriented as it was a first time for many of us .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46780 3:13 |now , i 'll be going into the history of seismic activity in virginia .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46781 3:18 |virginia does have an active seismic region but its seismic acitivity is n't as frequent| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46782 3:25 |as these of california , japan , and other parts of the world .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46783 3:35 |earthquakes in virginia tend to be of a very small magnitude , often gone undetectable .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46784 3:39 |from 1 as the most weakest to 10 being the most powerful in magnitudes of earthquakes ,| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46785 3:45 |virginia tend to experience tremors up to 3 which people do n't feel them .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46786 3:55 |so , the 5.8 earthquake yesterday was a rarity .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46787 4:00 |the earthquake yesterday was n't the most powerful in recorded history of earthquakes on the east coast .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46788 4:06 |the most powerful earthquake last recorded was a 5.9 , again in virginia , in 1897 .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46789 4:20 |so that 's 114 years .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46790 4:28 |by the way , that active seismic region in virginia is called central virginia seismic zone .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46791 4:41 |now for the differences on earthquakes between the west and the east coasts .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46792 4:48 |people in the west would think that a 5.8 earthquake is nothing and mock at how people here reacted ,| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46793 4:55 |people in washington , dc , new york , boston , and other cities running in blind panic , feeling lost and disoriented .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46794 5:08 |that is nothing to be sneered at , actually .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46795 5:12 |the land formation in the west is completely different from that of the east .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46796 5:15 |there in the west , the land is much more younger and more flexible .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46797 5:23 |also , the west coast is situated near the edge of a tectonic plate .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46798 5:33 |there are several tectonic plates all over the earth and are constantly moving .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46799 5:44 |we do n't feel it at all but they are constantly moving .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46800 5:51 |so , tectonic plates are constantly grinding against each other .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46801 5:57 |that 's why earthquakes are so frequent in places such as california , alaska , and japan .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46802 6:04 |while virginia is n't situated near the edge of the tectonic plate .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46803 6:08 |virginia is actually on the middle of the north america tectonic plate ,| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46804 6:14 |with california being on one end and the other end being in the middle of atlantic ocean .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46805 6:30 |so , remember i mentioned the land in the west being younger and more malleable ,| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46806 6:37 |the land formation here in the east is millions of years old , much older than the west .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46807 6:43 |so the bedrocks underneath are more compressed , rigid , and stable .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46808 6:50 |hence the reason the earthquake was felt in a much larger portion of the united states| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46809 6:57 |as opposed to earthquakes in the west , where they dissipates much faster .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46810 7:03 |with an earthquake of this magnitude in california , people in washington state might will not feel it .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46811 7:10 |think of a large glass pane being smashed ,| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46812 7:16 |not shattered , but smashed where it 'd look like a spider web .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46813 7:23 |if you touched the affected area of the glass , you 'd find that it 's flexible .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46814 7:26 |that 's california .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46815 7:28 |now with a glass pane with only one crack ,| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46816 7:31 |just like you 'd see a crack on the windsheild of an automobile ,| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46817 7:36 |the shock would be felt much stronger across the pane from that one crack .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46818 7:44 |there 's no other cracks to absorb the shock .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46819 7:58 |buildings in on the west coast are designed to withstand earthquakes ;| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46820 8:04 |their foundations and structures flexible .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46821 8:06 |it 's the opposite here in the east .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46822 8:09 |many buildings are old and historic and many others are built with bricks .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46823 8:12 |their foundations and sturctures are much more firm and solid .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46824 8:13 |a 5.8 earthquake would affect both regions differently .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46825 8:23 |a 5.8 earthquake would cause some structural damages here in the east as opposed to the west .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46826 8:28 |already there are some buildings here on the east coast that suffered some damages .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46827 8:30 |cracked walls and collapsed ceiling tiles due to a stronger conduct of the tremor .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46828 8:42 |as for what to do the next time an earthquake strikes ,| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46829 8:46 |be it here on the east coast| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46830 8:49 |- through the next `` big '' one probably wo n't happen for perhaps another hundred years| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46831 8:53 |- or visiting california and other parts of the world where earthquakes are much more prone .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46832 9:02 |it goes without saying that people in the east are `` rookies '' when it comes to earthquakes ,| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46833 9:06 |it 's a natural reaction for one to run out of a building .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46834 9:12 |actually , it is not a good idea to do that .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46835 9:16 |people trying to leave buildings during an earthquake may get hit by falling debris and walls .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46836 9:32 |in 1933 , long beach , california had an earthquake| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46837 9:37 |where 120 people died and many of them ran outside to be killed by falling debris .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46838 9:53 |the best thing to do is to stay inside ,| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46839 9:56 |get on the ground and take cover by a sturdy piece of furniture| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46840 10:00 |such as a table or a desk , and hold onto the legs of the table .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46841 10:07 |stay there until the shaking stops then proceed to evacuate the building .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46842 10:18 |do not stand near to a building .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46843 10:22 |find an area away from buildings , light poles , telephone poles , and wires .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46844 10:32 |stay there and wait until someone announces that the building is safe .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46845 10:39 |if you are in an old brick building , it might would be better| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46846 10:51 |for you to leave rather than hanging on inside .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46847 10:54 |these buildings are suspectible to collapsing .| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46848 10:58 |i hope you learned something !| X0xyGdvhsJ8
_*46849 11:00 |so long !| X0xyGdvhsJ8

_*46870 1:15 |service many law| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46871 1:18 |except do a quick arm| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46872 1:22 |you could maybe say many| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46873 1:26 |why or many husband for holly johnny and polyandry respectively| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46874 1:31 |are possibly many wife husband| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46875 1:35 |so woman man| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46876 1:38 |merry its allied on to say| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46877 1:42 |polygamy as sort of a mixed mister i 'm but| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46878 1:46 |i do n't really like because it 's awkward i another| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46879 1:52 |related i 'll thing is primary secondary is| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46880 1:55 |arm this means first so this is the number one| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46881 1:58 |so if you twisted and all of a little bit that 's first| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46882 2:02 |to to so| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46883 2:06 |twice that 's second one| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46884 2:09 |to first second i| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46885 2:13 |so if you add miss marker after it i| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46886 2:18 |it becomes first person second person as| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46887 2:21 |a primary a sec i 'll| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46888 2:25 |i think that 's no more or less covered there 's one more sign that might be nice| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46889 2:29 |arm which is connection asm you feel a connection| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46890 2:33 |arm thats this so you can| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46891 2:37 |bring it together a link| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46892 2:41 |are you here and say so| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46893 2:44 |emphasize it you can start from here and break it off| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46894 2:47 |i 'm say losing connection having a strong connection to| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46895 2:51 |this like many of them| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46896 2:55 |means change so i will use that| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46897 2:58 |you can say maybe many connections or| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46898 3:02 |of you could possibly use chain in| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46899 3:05 |this on a metaphorical sense but you knock| Q8T1CAYj57U
_*46900 3:09 |about so in summary i i 'd suggest many block| Q8T1CAYj57U

_*47397 1:11 |remember , it 's never ok to recommend terminating a pregnancy based solely on disability| diPnS2W44EU
_*47398 1:18 |or to assume that people with disabilities wo n't engage in sexual activity .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47399 1:23 |patients with disabilities might need some pointers too .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47400 1:26 |first of all , acknowledge your discomfort .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47401 1:29 |a good way to start the discussion is with a question .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47402 1:32 |it 's not the most comfortable topic but could we please talk about sex for a minute ?| diPnS2W44EU
_*47403 1:37 |approach the topic from a health perspective .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47404 1:40 |say i 'm concerned about thyroid problems because my interest in sex has dwindled| diPnS2W44EU
_*47405 1:46 |or i 'm having discomfort during sexual activity .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47406 1:50 |could this be due to medication ?| diPnS2W44EU
_*47407 1:51 |a doctor 's visit can be nerve wracking enough .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47408 1:54 |put your questions in writing so you wo n't forget what you need to say .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47409 1:58 |understand your body and your medical needs so you can explain what you 're looking for in terms| diPnS2W44EU
_*47410 2:04 |of contraception or specialists dealing with fertility .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47411 2:08 |the bottom line , it 's ok to talk about sex .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47412 2:12 |patients should have the confidence to discuss their needs and wants with medical providers .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47413 2:17 |and providers should encourage patients to speak up when they have questions or need resources .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47414 2:27 |a successful doctor 's visit does n't just happen .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47415 2:30 |it takes some planning in advance .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47416 2:32 |no matter what the situation , here 's how to make the most of your next doctor 's visit .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47417 2:38 |if you need accommodations during your medical appointments ,| diPnS2W44EU

_*47419 2:45 |a few examples of accommodations include an adjustable exam table ,| diPnS2W44EU
_*47420 2:50 |a sign language interpreter or assistance with completing paperwork .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47421 2:54 |during your visit ask questions regarding any treatments ,| diPnS2W44EU
_*47422 2:58 |test or medications you do n't understand .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47423 3:02 |write down your own questions beforehand and list the most important ones first| diPnS2W44EU
_*47424 3:06 |to make sure they get asked and answered .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47425 3:09 |remember , you are the patient .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47426 3:12 |unless you choose otherwise , do n't let others speak for you .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47427 3:15 |make sure your provider speaks directly to you and not a companion or family member .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47428 3:21 |ask your provider to draw pictures or show a model| diPnS2W44EU
_*47429 3:24 |to explain the complicated treatment or diagnosis .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47430 3:27 |take notes or ask for written instructions .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47431 3:31 |bring an audio recorder or assisted technology if needed .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47432 3:34 |whatever works best for you .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47433 3:37 |ask for brochures , audio recording or visuals to help you understand .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47434 3:42 |let providers know if you need assistance or have questions about medication .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47435 3:46 |for example , you might need a medicine bottle without child protected lids ,| diPnS2W44EU
_*47436 3:51 |a pill crusher or even liquefied medication .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47437 3:54 |if you 're waiting on tests and have n't heard from your provider in a reasonable amount| diPnS2W44EU
_*47438 3:58 |of time , call them back and ask for your results .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47439 4:02 |be proactive about your health .| diPnS2W44EU
_*47440 4:05 |and remember that you have the right to choose your provider .| diPnS2W44EU

_*47462 0:33 |with just a few challenges that we have to contend with .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47463 0:37 |> > i think one of the biggest things that we love to do we are both avid readers and we want| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47464 0:44 |to teach a love of reading for our children so we have books that we have brailled .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47465 0:51 |they 're in print and they also have the pictures so the children can see and the braille is| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47466 0:58 |over the print so us as a blind person can read the braille| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47467 1:05 |and someone sighted could also read the book as well to our children .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47468 1:09 |we also have flashcards brailled so that we can teach those same concepts .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47469 1:16 |so they see the picture and we 're able to know if they have given us a correct answer .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47470 1:22 |what letter is this ?| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47471 1:24 |what color is that frog ?| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47472 1:26 |technology is wonderful today and we use our iphones for apps with our children| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47473 1:32 |and teach them colors and numbers and animals and things like that .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47474 1:40 |> > we 're trying to do all the same things that any good parents would want to do .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47475 1:46 |we just have to adapt certain things because of the fact that we 're blind .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47476 1:52 |our children are like any other children because they both have sight| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47477 1:57 |and they live in the sighted world .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47478 1:59 |it 's amazing already what we can tell our son being four ,| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47479 2:03 |he is so excited about describing things to us , showing us things .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47480 2:08 |he 'll take mommy and daddy 's hand and put it on what he 's wanting to show us .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47481 2:14 |so first he 'll describe it .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47482 2:15 |it 's really funny and then he 'll want to show it to us so it 's amazing like that .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47483 2:21 |> > our children are growing up in a sighted world so we want to give them| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47484 2:26 |as much opportunity as we possibly can .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47485 2:29 |for example , we do n't want our children in 30 years to say well , we did n't get to go| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47486 2:35 |to disney world because our parents were blind so we take our children to parks , to the zoo ,| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47487 2:45 |to the children 's museum , to indoor and outdoor play areas and generally we do| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47488 2:52 |that with a person that we have hired for our family .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47489 2:59 |and that 's not a caretaker it 's just , i call it an assistant who works with us| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47490 3:05 |about ten hours a week and when we go to the park we have them take our children with one| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47491 3:14 |of us and they will describe things .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47492 3:17 |oh , well your son is climbing to the highest point on that jungle gym| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47493 3:25 |or your daughter is playing with dirt and putting it in her mouth .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47494 3:29 |just so that we know what 's going on so that if we need to correct a behavior ,| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47495 3:35 |if we need to modify a behavior , if we need to give praise we can do that .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47496 3:41 |that person is strictly our eyes not the disciplinarian , not the parent .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47497 3:47 |we are still that parent .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47498 3:49 |> > sometimes we will take family with us as well .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47499 3:53 |jennifer 's family is here local .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47500 3:55 |my family comes to see us quite often but we 've never expected them to go over and above| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47501 4:00 |or do anything different because we are blind so that 's why a lot of times we go out| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47502 4:06 |and find our own assistants because we want to make sure that our family is as involved| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47503 4:12 |as they want to be but that we do n't expect them to do more .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47504 4:15 |there 's lots of strange comments that we get from time to time and you almost feel sorry| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47505 4:21 |for somebody who asks but then you think on the other hand they really do n't know and so again ,| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47506 4:26 |that 's one reason why we want to be as visible with our children too as we can .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47507 4:32 |> > so when we go in , imagine this .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47508 4:35 |we go into a restaurant .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47509 4:37 |we go into a store both of us are blind .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47510 4:41 |both of us have guide dogs and we have two children ,| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47511 4:47 |one of them is four and holding our hand .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47512 4:51 |the other one is one and is either rolled in a stroller that we pull behind us or she might be| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47513 5:03 |on a carrier on our back or because she 's walking we might be holding her hand too .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47514 5:11 |people are so amazed and in such awe , `` wow , i ca n't believe you can do that . ''| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47515 5:16 |but you know being a parent is one of the most challenging things i think| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47516 5:19 |for anybody whether you have a disability or not .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47517 5:22 |people have asked us before how can we be parents if we have a disability ?| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47518 5:28 |what would be some advice that we would give anybody else ?| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47519 5:31 |and i really think that the biggest thing is you have to believe in yourself first of all| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47520 5:39 |that you can do it that anything is possible .| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47521 5:44 |well then after you get that figured out , you say okay , now literally how am i going to do it ?| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47522 5:50 |the answer there is i think is you have to surround yourself with positive people ,| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47523 5:55 |people who also believe that you can do it like your family ,| NTRr5Igpumo
_*47524 5:58 |maybe your parents or friends who support you .| NTRr5Igpumo

_*47595 0:05 |hello . before i start , i would like to thank the general studies department for inviting me to give a| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47596 0:12 |presentation about american sign language ( asl ) literature . it all began in one of my classes that| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47597 0:31 |there was a period of time , during the 1980s and the 1990s , where asl literature flourished like no other| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47598 0:39 |and then stopped shortly afterwards - in a way , the whole era became frozen in time . i have an unusual theory to| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47599 0:51 |language . the signing community was reluctant to agree with dr. stokoe at first , but the community eventually| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47600 0:58 |came to endorse his findings as time passed by . as acceptance of asl became widespread , others asked| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47601 1:03 |whether there was a culture in the signing community . there were members of the community who truly| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47602 1:07 |believed there was a culture , and they began to create sample of my work and numbers of videos . with the| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47603 1:11 |videos , the naysayers eventually learned that there is such a thing as deaf culture . those who worked so hard| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47604 1:47 |are they alike or entirely different ? i will also cover certain elements of literature that should be included in| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47605 1:54 |your work . you will see a sample of my work and hopefully it will inspire you to create your own| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47606 1:59 |work very soon !| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47607 2:06 |there are countless genres in asl literature and i will select just a few . whatever i select to share , they do| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47608 2:12 |not represent the whole picture of asl literature . for example , i read an assigned book ,| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47609 2:35 |younger brother if he read the same book . he did and the assigned grade level remains the same . literature is| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47610 2:41 |embedded in our educational system . specific literature is assigned at an expected grade level for the students .| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47611 2:53 |for example , high school students tend to read romeo and juliet . the constant exposure of literature may| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47612 3:04 |bring a sense of identity as an american to the readers , while this is not the same thing for the deaf community| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47613 3:08 |and we do not have specific literature assigned to grade levels . being exposed to a few deaf literature ,| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47614 3:12 |because of that , it is possible to answer why deaf individuals struggle with their identities as deaf| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47615 3:20 |persons . we should already have an established genres for elementary , middle and high school students .| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47616 3:30 |it is interesting how literature can mold you as a person . think about this : with a different culture somewhere| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47617 3:34 |in the world also comes different literature and folklore with different meanings .| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47618 3:44 |this concept presents how powerful literature is in our society .| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47619 4:02 |tribal communities in south america or africa . their literature tends to be passed on from generation to| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47620 4:14 |generation . when outsiders visit their community , it is possible the outsiders may assume their language is 0:04:20.000,0:04:23.000 too simple , as if they are not able to discuss the meaning of life . also , the literature shared in the| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47621 4:24 |community is highly valued by the native members . unfortunately , this can result in oppression because| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47622 4:31 |there are no actual written documents . does this mean the same thing for the values of| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47623 4:35 |asl literature ?| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47624 4:44 |the values between traditional and asl literatures are similar . the outsiders can not understand asl .| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47625 4:52 |the native signers embrace their own language and gain a strong sense of identity and relationship| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47626 5:01 |with the community . the literature is also passed down from one generation to the next . the outsiders| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47627 5:05 |may not understand the significance of asl because there are no written documents for| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47628 5:15 |evolution theory , in terms of favoring the best , fittest and strongest . this theory made a deep| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47629 5:27 |the people believed it to be true and did not encourage signing as they wanted deaf people| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47630 5:38 |they definitely did not . they still used asl and created literature . asl literature was passed| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47631 6:10 |where , who , when , what and why . it is important to incorporate the message of author in the story .| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47632 6:20 |it will not make any sense if you do a a to z story for the sake of doing it a to z style . be sure to| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47633 6:51 |plot elements that mentally prepares you to create different settings . you can create additional| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47634 6:58 |characters or include a villain that causes conflicts . these will lead to a climax , ending with a solution| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47635 7:04 |at the end of the story . the options are endless . you can have four conflicts and then add on one| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47636 7:14 |more before conclusion . the plot elements are merely your tools as you create your story .| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47637 7:33 |i have shared plot elements and narrative elements and they do parallel in some ways| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47638 7:44 |with asl literature . for example , personal experiences , personification , poetry , classifier| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47639 7:52 |stories , and percussion , which is based on rhythms , are some of the ways . rathskellar ,| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47640 7:58 |a deaf musical group , is well-known for its use of percussion in asl such as sharing their| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47641 8:01 |story about bad cowboys . that story has plot elements , connections and a conclusion . this| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47642 8:12 |will leave the audience entertained . research has shown that when a child grows up as a| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47643 8:19 |bilingual person where asl and english are valued equally since birth they are more| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47644 8:36 |as you get ready to start filming , the first step is an accurate white balance . the first time i| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47645 8:45 |created a video , the color was off as my skin was orange-ish with a blurry blue background| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47646 8:51 |behind me . one way to ensure an effective white balance is to zoom into the white paper| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47647 8:24 |in the front of your face . make sure the focus is clear and smooth then zoom out .| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47648 8:58 |the next step is following asl linguistic rules based on five parameters : movement ,| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47649 9:06 |handshape , location , palm orientation and nonmanual signals . as long as you remember| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47650 9:12 |the technical pointers and the five parameters , your literature will be all ready to go .| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47651 9:29 |should look like along with some necessary information such as citations and et cetera .| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47652 9:33 |in this video , you will see different signers who collaborated together to create some magnificent| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47653 9:39 |asl literature ! hopefully what i have shared with you will be inspirational for you all .| yOAmYSW3WyU
_*47654 9:46 |the list of sources used will be shown to you after this presentation .| yOAmYSW3WyU

_*47714 1:31 |it 's a great way to plant per check although it is rather expensive| jyQutDquPGU
_*47715 1:36 |now the other way you can do it is the way that my family does it and me sorta| jyQutDquPGU
_*47716 1:41 |do it ourselves where do it ourselves homeowners the first time i had gone| jyQutDquPGU
_*47717 1:46 |i a made a left-hand put that into my computer| jyQutDquPGU
_*47718 1:50 |and that way i know exactly what it is but i need in every year i can just| jyQutDquPGU
_*47719 1:55 update jyQutDquPGU
_*47720 1:56 |that list and print it out and i know what to do| jyQutDquPGU
_*47721 1:59 |pack i is that big pack call to duluth pack| jyQutDquPGU

_*47723 2:08 |i 'll use a plastic liner| jyQutDquPGU
_*47724 2:09 |burned tires see them go and then a throw it out but i know some people who| jyQutDquPGU
_*47725 2:13 |like to reuse the liner year after year season after season| jyQutDquPGU
_*47726 2:17 |but i use this dilute did n't pack for big things like that tent| jyQutDquPGU
_*47727 2:22 |sleeping bad camping gear is what i put into the duluth pack| jyQutDquPGU
_*47728 2:27 |i 'm again attend the sleeping bag| jyQutDquPGU
_*47729 2:31 |hobble bigger items going to this larger to| jyQutDquPGU
_*47730 2:34 |pack men i have another pack that i use| jyQutDquPGU
_*47731 2:38 |foreclose i 'm it 's not a doodle| jyQutDquPGU
_*47732 2:42 |duluth pack it 's another one it 's like a backpack only| jyQutDquPGU
_*47733 2:45 |it it 's specifically made for| jyQutDquPGU
_*47734 2:49 |camping on and it does n't close like your typical| jyQutDquPGU
_*47735 2:54 |backpack you open a flat on the top and then there 's a draw string| jyQutDquPGU
_*47736 2:58 |that keeps everything inside and keeps it all together| jyQutDquPGU
_*47737 3:01 |so it 's a little bit different than a regular backpack but kinda with the| jyQutDquPGU
_*47738 3:05 |millers thighs| jyQutDquPGU
_*47739 3:06 |although it is made up robber which is great| jyQutDquPGU
_*47740 3:09 |for camping and canoeing but that means that it 's a little bit more expensive| jyQutDquPGU
_*47741 3:13 |of course and i love my family we 've had callers are closed into it this| jyQutDquPGU
_*47742 3:19 |one rapper pack we try| jyQutDquPGU
_*47743 3:22 |cue packet lightly as possible we do n't want| jyQutDquPGU
_*47744 3:26 |lino each family member to have three four pairs of pants and jeans and| jyQutDquPGU
_*47745 3:30 |3456 shirts we try to go ahead simple as possible| jyQutDquPGU
_*47746 3:35 |things that are lightweight on possibly made nylon are made of a material that| jyQutDquPGU
_*47747 3:40 |will keep you warm| jyQutDquPGU
_*47748 3:41 |there 's specific brands very| jyQutDquPGU
_*47749 3:45 |then and very warm dry| jyQutDquPGU
_*47750 3:49 |typeof clothing used for camping and canoeing| jyQutDquPGU
_*47751 3:52 |that 's the kinda clothing that i would recommend their lightweight for easy to| jyQutDquPGU
_*47752 3:56 carry jyQutDquPGU
_*47753 3:57 |and to keep you dry and warm a lot of people packed| jyQutDquPGU
_*47754 4:02 |several pairs of boots as well shoes boots and i tried again do as minimally| jyQutDquPGU
_*47755 4:07 |is possible and pack a pair| jyQutDquPGU
_*47756 4:08 |i 'm and shoes and a pair of boots and that 's about it| jyQutDquPGU
_*47757 4:12 |as much as i try to i 'm to carry i do n't have to carry too much| jyQutDquPGU
_*47758 4:16 |effort preparing for food equipment i use that propane stove and we praying| jyQutDquPGU
_*47759 4:23 |a propane stove with us with propane canisters| jyQutDquPGU
_*47760 4:26 |that seems to have worked the best for us and that 's how we like to prepare| jyQutDquPGU
_*47761 4:30 food jyQutDquPGU
_*47762 4:31 |and then actual food itself there are some| jyQutDquPGU
_*47763 4:35 |dehydrated from dried food that you could| jyQutDquPGU
_*47764 4:38 |her chest its it 's pretty expensive to| jyQutDquPGU
_*47765 4:41 |and i try to do it as cheaply as possible so i well| jyQutDquPGU
_*47766 4:45 |usually cook and prepare my food about a week in advance| jyQutDquPGU
_*47767 4:49 |make things like chile| jyQutDquPGU
_*47768 4:52 |mic input chilean to add the clock back| jyQutDquPGU
_*47769 4:55 |that way it stays steeled| jyQutDquPGU
_*47770 4:59 |i 'm and those are the type of things that i make recently this past christmas| jyQutDquPGU
_*47771 5:04 |my father bought for me a food saver machine| jyQutDquPGU
_*47772 5:07 |that feels the plastic bags themselves and they wo n't leak| jyQutDquPGU
_*47773 5:11 |a double bagged everything so that 's a wonderful| jyQutDquPGU
_*47774 5:15 |on those wonderful christmas gift that i could use for our boundary waters canoe| jyQutDquPGU
_*47775 5:19 |area traps| jyQutDquPGU
_*47776 5:21 |the same thing with the drink you do n't want to have to carry anything it 's a| jyQutDquPGU
_*47777 5:24 |very happy| jyQutDquPGU
_*47778 5:26 |so i a will often pack dry powdered| jyQutDquPGU
_*47779 5:29 |things like holding so that we can make that with some water while we 're| jyQutDquPGU
_*47780 5:33 |on fight weather pack for all the camping gear| jyQutDquPGU
_*47781 5:37 |a pack for clothes in another pack for are| jyQutDquPGU
_*47782 5:40 |third and then you have to think about that actual| jyQutDquPGU
_*47783 5:43 |new itself my family we do n't own our own pin new| jyQutDquPGU
_*47784 5:47 |we will rent one from an outfitter when we actually get to this site| jyQutDquPGU
_*47785 5:51 |there 's a lot of different choices you could get an aluminum canoe| jyQutDquPGU
_*47786 5:55 |a wink in new kevlar several different types at| jyQutDquPGU
_*47787 5:59 |at can use that they have available styles colors and types| jyQutDquPGU
_*47788 6:04 |for me and my family i do n't like the aluminum on it 's just| jyQutDquPGU
_*47789 6:08 |too heavy to carry the wood ones are nice and i 've seen| jyQutDquPGU
_*47790 6:12 |some families who actually build and make your own whitkin news| jyQutDquPGU
_*47791 6:16 |and their just gorgeous| jyQutDquPGU
_*47792 6:20 |again my suggestion would be think about an outfitter| jyQutDquPGU
_*47793 6:23 |and i 'm if you 've never| jyQutDquPGU
_*47794 6:26 |can you be four that 's when i get back option they have everything they bring| jyQutDquPGU
_*47795 6:30 |it out to the campsite| jyQutDquPGU

_*48452 0:06 |hello ! so you 're pretty excited about your child learning sign language .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48453 0:11 |they 're learning new words and signs every day and you 're pretty excited about that .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48454 0:15 |but you may have noticed that their signs often look funny or wrong .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48455 0:20 |and so you 're wondering , why are they making these mistakes ?| DP1v8icEFro
_*48456 0:24 |did you know that all children , whether they 're learning signed language or spoken language| DP1v8icEFro
_*48457 0:28 |will often make mistakes . that 's a normal part of the language acquisition process .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48458 0:34 |this video will explain three kinds of errors that children often make when learning sign language .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48459 0:41 |those errors are very common to all children ( learning sign language ) .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48460 0:45 |also , often when children are learning sign language| DP1v8icEFro
_*48461 0:48 |they 'll learn one specific skill for sign language and get better at it| DP1v8icEFro
_*48462 0:51 |but then they get worse at it and you may start to worry| DP1v8icEFro
_*48463 0:55 |and then they get better at it . that often happens and is normal , too .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48464 0:59 |the three types we 'll discuss today are| DP1v8icEFro
_*48465 1:03 |handshape markedness| DP1v8icEFro
_*48466 1:09 sympathy DP1v8icEFro
_*48467 1:12 |and proximalization .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48468 1:15 |i 'll expand on each one of these now .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48469 1:17 |first , handshape markedness . what 's that ?| DP1v8icEFro
_*48470 1:24 |if we think about how all signs have handshapes ,| DP1v8icEFro
_*48471 1:26 |for example , the sign for horse uses the h ( or u ) handshape .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48472 1:30 |and the sign for play uses the y handshape .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48473 1:32 |and the sign for parents uses the 5 handshape .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48474 1:35 |but not all handshapes are the same .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48475 1:39 |some handshapes are more difficult to make than others .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48476 1:42 |for example , the handshapes k , r , x , and 7 are somewhat more hard| DP1v8icEFro
_*48477 1:48 |or what we call `` more marked '' than other , easier handshapes| DP1v8icEFro
_*48478 1:51 |like 5 , b , l , c , and o , those are easier handshapes to make .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48479 1:57 |research has shown that children who learn sign language| DP1v8icEFro
_*48480 2:01 |tend to pick up the easier , less marked handshapes first| DP1v8icEFro
_*48481 2:04 |they will pick up those first and later , when they get older ,| DP1v8icEFro
_*48482 2:08 |and have better control of their hands and fingers , they will pick up| DP1v8icEFro
_*48483 2:12 |those harder , more marked handshapes like 7 , r , k .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48484 2:18 |so children will often take a sign that requires a more marked handshape| DP1v8icEFro
_*48485 2:22 |for example , the sign for play , they will replace the more marked handshape| DP1v8icEFro
_*48486 2:25 |with an easier , less marked handshape| DP1v8icEFro
_*48487 2:29 |so the sign for play will now use a 5 handshape instead of a y handshape .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48488 2:33 |or the sign for cow ( with a y handshape ) now uses the a handshape| DP1v8icEFro
_*48489 2:35 |and telephone ( again , with a y handshape ) changes to the a handshape .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48490 2:38 |and yellow changes to the 5 handshape .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48491 2:41 |those are just a few examples of how children substitute less marked handshapes for signs with more marked handshapes .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48492 2:48 |and that 's pretty normal for children who are learning sign language .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48493 2:52 |done with the first , now let 's discuss sympathy .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48494 2:57 |sympathy means when both hands use the same handshape .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48495 3:01 |you know how several signs use two hands ?| DP1v8icEFro
_*48496 3:05 |but sometimes those two hands use different handshapes ,| DP1v8icEFro
_*48497 3:07 |for example , the sign for cookie uses two different handshapes| DP1v8icEFro
_*48498 3:10 |the 5 and claw handshapes , and those are different .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48499 3:13 |children may find these type of signs hard| DP1v8icEFro
_*48500 3:16 |because they have to think about making two different handshapes at the same time .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48501 3:19 |so they 'll just change the sign so the handshapes are the same .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48502 3:21 |like , cookie would use two claw handshapes| DP1v8icEFro
_*48503 3:24 |or fall , which , again , uses two different handshapes ( v and 5 )| DP1v8icEFro
_*48504 3:25 |children may find this hard , so they change the sign to use two v handshapes| DP1v8icEFro
_*48505 3:28 |and so here both handshapes become the same .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48506 3:30 |they find it easier to sign this way , and then when they get older| DP1v8icEFro
_*48507 3:33 |and better at signing , they 'll learn how they can make two different handshapes .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48508 3:40 |and now the third , proximalization .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48509 3:44 |this is the sign for proximalization .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48510 3:47 |all signs use movement in the joints , maybe at the wrist or at the fingers| DP1v8icEFro
_*48511 3:54 |and that , we 'll focus on those joints here .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48512 3:57 |children who are still learning how to use their hands , arms , and joints| DP1v8icEFro
_*48513 4:02 |will often use a different , easier , bigger joint| DP1v8icEFro
_*48514 4:08 |maybe moving from the wrist to the elbow , or from the elbow to the shoulder .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48515 4:11 |for example , the horse sign uses the knuckle joints here .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48516 4:15 |children may find that joint a little hard to use , so they 'll use the wrist joint instead .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48517 4:19 |or the fish sign , which uses the wrist joint ,| DP1v8icEFro
_*48518 4:22 |will now use the elbow joint like this .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48519 4:25 |so they use an easier , more proximal joint closer to the body .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48520 4:30 |that 's also pretty common in children who are learning sign language .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48521 4:35 |i 've just discussed three common errors children make when acquiring sign language| DP1v8icEFro
_*48522 4:40 |but there 's more out there .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48523 4:43 |the point here is , children often make systematic , predictable errors| DP1v8icEFro
_*48524 4:49 |and that is just a normal part of language acquisition .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48525 4:54 |there 's more that i could list ! so if you 're worried about your child| DP1v8icEFro
_*48526 4:57 |do n't worry if they make those errors . the important thing here to do| DP1v8icEFro
_*48527 5:00 |to provide a good sign language model -- sign often to your child and they will pick it up .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48528 5:04 |as they grow , and develop improved control of their hands and arms| DP1v8icEFro
_*48529 5:08 |their signing will become closer to adult-like signing .| DP1v8icEFro
_*48530 0:04 |it hard| 7PLyZe_sKb4

_*48730 2:13 |let 's take a look at the different types of providers who offer support .| cqPC7BfvNPY

_*48732 2:25 |ens offer a range of services to help you prepare for and find work .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48733 2:31 |ens may specialize in supporting certain populations , or may offer individualized services that| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48734 2:38 |begin with job exploration and continue after you are on the job to help you succeed in the workforce .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48735 2:46 |some ens are called `` workforce ens '' , which means that they can provide access to a wide| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48736 2:53 |array of employment support services , including training programs and special programs .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48737 3:01 |each state has vocational rehabilitation agencies or vr that can help you explore your employment options .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48738 3:08 |vr agencies offer a range of support services to help you prepare for the workforce and find a job .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48739 3:17 |once you have found work , the services you receive from vr come to an end .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48740 3:24 |social security rules around employment and benefits are complicated .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48741 3:29 |most people need help understanding how earning money at a job will affect their disability benefits .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48742 3:36 |you can find this help , known as `` benefits counseling '' , at a provider called a| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48743 3:42 |work incentives planning and assistance project or wipa project .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48744 3:49 |organizations known as protection and advocacy for beneficiaries of social security , or pabss ,| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48745 3:57 |focus on removing barriers to employment for beneficiaries with disabilities who want to work .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48746 4:03 |pabss help people understand and protect their employment rights .| cqPC7BfvNPY

_*48748 4:16 |offer to help you reach your employment goals . we understand that the career development| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48749 4:23 |services you need are unique , and the ticket program can help connect you with the right| cqPC7BfvNPY

_*48753 4:43 |you are automatically eligible for this program .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48754 4:48 |how does this ticket program work ?| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48755 4:51 |when considering employment , think about what your work goals are . the ticket program is| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48756 4:57 |set up to give you tools that help you decide where you want to go and how to get there .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48757 5:03 |participating in ticket to work usually means going through some steps we will talk about next .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48758 5:09 |keep in mind that because each person 's circumstances are unique , not everyone will| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48759 5:16 |go through every one of these steps in the exact same order that they are presented here .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48760 5:23 |participating in ticket to work is a little different for everyone .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48761 5:27 |in general here 's how the program works .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48762 5:32 |1 . meet with a benefits counselor| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48763 5:35 |you will want to meet with someone who is ready to help you understand how work will| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48764 5:40 |affect your social security disability benefits ( ssdi or ssi ) . there are professionals who| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48765 5:47 |are trained and certified to offer advice about employment and benefits . they are called| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48766 5:53 |`` benefits counselors '' . the benefits counselor can help you decide whether this ticket program| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48767 5:59 |works for you and if you are ready for it . you will find a benefits counselor at a work| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48768 6:04 |incentives planning & assistance project , or wipa . some ens also have benefits counselors on staff .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48769 6:12 |in part 3 , i will show you how to find wipa and ens that can help you .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48770 6:23 |2 . find a ticket to work service provider| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48771 6:26 |now , once you have decided to begin exploring your options , you can choose an| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48772 6:31 |en or vr to see if the services they offer| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48773 6:34 |are right for you . vr agencies and ens offer a range of different kinds of employment support services to help you .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48774 6:43 |1. prepare you for the workforce ; 2. look for work ;| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48775 6:52 |3. find a job ; or 4. keep the job you currently have .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48776 6:58 |feel free to talk with as many providers as you want .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48777 7:03 |we have a check list readily available for you to use during those interviews ,| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48778 7:09 |to help you select a provider .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48779 7:13 |3 . develop an individual work plan| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48780 7:18 |once you find a provider , and you and the provider agree to work together , your provider| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48781 7:24 |will inform social security that you are participating in the ticket program . you and your provider| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48782 7:31 |will develop a written plan designed to help you achieve your employment goals . this is| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48783 7:38 |called an `` individual work plan '' . the goals in each person 's work plan are different .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48784 7:44 |that is why it is called an individual work plan . for example , one| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48785 7:52 |person 's goals might include taking training courses to prepare for a future job .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48786 7:58 |someone else 's goals could include earning a certain amount of money at their current job , or finding| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48787 8:04 |a new job . your chosen provider will be there to help you each step of the way .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48788 8:12 |4 . make timely progress| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48789 8:17 |as a ticket program participant , you will be responsible for making timely progress| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48790 8:23 |in achieving the goals outlined in your individual work plan . making timely progress means achieving| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48791 8:30 |these goals within the timeframes set by social security . if you have questions about timely| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48792 8:38 |progress , be sure to ask your provider . they are there to help .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48793 8:45 |5 . go to work !| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48794 8:48 |the idea behind ticket to work is to give you choices about the kinds of support you will| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48795 8:54 |receive to go to work . some people just want help finding a job . others may continue| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48796 9:01 |to receive ongoing employment support services through ticket to work to help them stay employed .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48797 9:08 |there will be more on this topic in part 2 : from benefits to employment .| cqPC7BfvNPY

_*48807 10:15 |people to transition into the workforce while continuing to| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48808 10:19 |receive medicaid or medicare , and some cash benefits from social security .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48809 10:26 |these rules are called `` work incentives '' . there are many different work| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48810 10:31 |incentives that allow people to focus on preparing for , finding| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48811 10:35 |and maintaining employment . some are in place so that people continue to receive benefits| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48812 10:42 |while they test their ability to work . other rules may allow| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48813 10:47 |people who have stopped working because of their disability to| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48814 10:51 |resume benefits without a new application . because each person 's circumstances are| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48815 10:57 |different , it is a good idea to talk with a certified professional ,| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48816 11:01 |known as a benefits counselor . a benefits counselor can help you| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48817 11:05 |understand how work incentives apply to you , so you can make an informed decision about employment .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48818 11:18 |you will find benefits counseling help at an organization in your community called a| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48819 11:24 |`` work incentives planning & assistance , '' or wipa project . many employment networks| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48820 11:30 |also have benefits counselors on staff . part 3 of this series will show you where| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48821 11:35 |you can find a benefits counselor to help you understand how work will affect your disability benefits .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48822 11:43 |who can help me with employment ?| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48823 11:46 |once you know how work will affect your benefits , after meeting with a benefits counselor , you| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48824 11:52 |will want to meet with a ticket program service provider . many providers can help you find| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48825 11:58 |your way to a successful career . one kind of service provider is known as an `` employment| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48826 12:05 |network '' or en . remember , i mentioned in part 1 about ens . they can help you explore| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48827 12:13 |your options and offer you different kinds of supports and services to help you prepare| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48828 12:19 |for , find , or maintain employment . again , every beneficiary is different , and so is| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48829 12:26 |each service provider . so finding a good fit is important .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48830 12:33 |i 'd like to talk a little bit about what makes ens special . some have expertise that| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48831 12:41 |make them equipped to meet specific needs . ens may specialize in serving people with| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48832 12:48 |certain disabilities , or specific groups of people , such as individuals who are deaf or| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48833 12:54 |hard of hearing . some are based in local communities and will work with you in person . other ens| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48834 13:02 |serve people in multiple states , and will help work with you over the phone or by email .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48835 13:09 |overall , ens aim to help you achieve your employment goals .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48836 13:18 |now , let 's talk about another service provider introduced in part 1 : a vocational rehabilitation| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48837 13:25 |agency or vr . vr agencies also help people find work . if you find a job with help from| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48838 13:34 |a vr agency , you can receive ongoing support services through an en of your choice , after| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48839 13:41 |your vr case is closed .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48840 13:44 |what types of services do ens and vr agencies offer ?| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48841 13:49 |i just explained to you what ens and vr agencies are . now let 's talk| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48842 13:55 |about what they offer . they both provide services through the ticket program to help you prepare| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48843 14:01 |for and find work . for example , both may offer career counseling , guide you through a job search ,| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48844 14:08 |help you land a job , or help you develop new career skills .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48845 14:15 |a vr agency can work with you if you need more significant services , such as training , education , and assistive| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48846 14:23 |technology . ens may offer other specialized supports to meet a unique set of needs over time .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48847 14:31 |ens and vr agencies sometimes work together , to provide people with a continuum| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48848 14:37 |of employment supports . in this way , the ticket program sets people up for success in the workforce .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48849 14:46 |for example , many people benefit from support| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48850 14:49 |services that continue after they have found a job . ens provide that kind of help .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48851 14:57 |job coaching or advice about job accommodations , are examples of the| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48852 15:02 |`` job retention services '' some ens offer . a good en will help you stay in touch with social security .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48853 15:11 |your en may make sure you are reporting your earnings properly .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48854 15:17 |they may also help you understand correspondence you receive from the social security administration .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48855 15:29 |some people find a job with help from vr , and then choose an en for ongoing support| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48856 15:35 |services that help them stay employed after their vr case is closed .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48857 15:42 |others work with an en from the beginning . whether you work with vr , an en or both , the services they| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48858 15:49 |provide can support you in each step toward self-sufficiency !| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48859 16:03 |it 's me again , kelly , at the social security administration . in this third and final| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48860 16:10 |part of our series , `` finding your path to employment with ticket to work '' , you will| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48861 16:15 |learn where you can go to find help .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48862 16:18 |remember , i mentioned an online feature of social security 's web site in part 1 , called the `` find help tool '' ?| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48863 16:28 |let 's take a look at what it is about , and see all the features it offers !| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48864 16:37 |the find help tool can help you locate service providers to meet a range of needs .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48865 16:43 |the find help tool can help you find ens , vr agencies , wipa projects and other providers that serve your area .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48866 17:07 |you can search for service providers in two ways .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48867 17:37 |once you begin your search for providers , you can narrow your search to look for specific types of providers .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48868 17:52 |speak a language of choice ; offer specialized services ; or serve a local region .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48869 17:59 |for example , you can find benefits counseling at your local wipa project by entering your zip code ,| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48870 18:15 |you can refine your search further by selecting the different options available in| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48871 19:07 |the tool allows you to save and print your customized list of service providers .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48872 19:12 |once you have the list of service providers that will meet your needs ,| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48873 19:24 |on this screen you can decide which layout you want your list to be printed .| cqPC7BfvNPY

_*48876 19:50 |such as number of tickets assigned , the number of years as an employment network , and so on .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48877 19:57 |still need help ? you can also contact the ticket to work help line ,| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48878 20:02 |shown at the end of this video , to ask for a list of service providers that may be able to work with you .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48879 20:07 |the help line representative will either email or mail the list to you .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48880 20:12 |please note , if you are viewing this website on a mobile device or tablet , you may not be able to see all of these features .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48881 20:21 |with the right support through ticket to work , you can find your way to better earnings and personal fulfillment through employment .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48882 20:31 |the idea is to help you earn your way off of cash benefits so you no longer have to rely on a fixed income .| cqPC7BfvNPY
_*48883 20:39 |when you reduce your dependence on ssdi or ssi , you will have more choices .| cqPC7BfvNPY

_*49968 0:04 |some basic signs , words , phrases in sign language . in this clip , let 's learn some animals . what| 443bQO7_A9o
_*49969 0:11 |you 'll notice with a lot of signs is that there are very literal to what you would normally| 443bQO7_A9o
_*49970 0:16 |do in daily life . for instance , a dog , if we jump to dog for a moment , a dog , what you 'll| 443bQO7_A9o
_*49971 0:23 |want to do is take your hand , slap your side , and snap twice , dog ; like you 're calling a| 443bQO7_A9o
_*49972 0:33 |dog . dog . cat , if you were to pretend you are a cat with whiskers , you would do this .| 443bQO7_A9o
_*49973 0:42 |your three fingers are open and you would take your index finger and your thumb and| 443bQO7_A9o
_*49974 0:47 |it 's like you 're pulling at your whiskers . so cat , we know dog . what about rabbit ? take| 443bQO7_A9o
_*49975 0:56 |your two fingers like you are forming ears , rabbit , rabbit . fish , what do fish do ? they| 443bQO7_A9o
_*49976 1:06 |swim , so you take your hand and motion it swimming , fish , fish . butterfly , of course| 443bQO7_A9o
_*49977 1:15 |many people you see do this anyways , but butterfly , it looks like a butterfly . if you were to| 443bQO7_A9o
_*49978 1:20 |do say hand shadows on a wall , butterfly . finally , bird , think of a bird 's beak . so| 443bQO7_A9o
_*49979 1:29 |bird is like this , you take your index finger and your thumb like you were moving your beak| 443bQO7_A9o
_*49980 1:37 |and you hold it toward your nose then or at your nose . if you can think of another bird| 443bQO7_A9o
_*49981 1:43 |for instance , an owl . what do you think an owl will look like ? of course something like| 443bQO7_A9o
_*49982 1:48 |this , that 's an owl as well .| 443bQO7_A9o
_*49983 0:00 |hello ! my name is melissa schenk and on behalf of expert village today we 're going to be| 6s7a4lSlnro

_*49985 0:08 |alphabet and the numbers 1-10 . now in this clip , we 'll learn j , k , and l. now , we just| 6s7a4lSlnro
_*49986 0:16 |did i of course . j is very similar to i . you want to keep that same pinky finger up , and| 6s7a4lSlnro
_*49987 0:22 |with j you 're simply going to actually make the letter j . just like that . j . we start| 6s7a4lSlnro
_*49988 0:29 |off with i , j . just like that . j. k , a little bit more challenging . k looks like this . you 're| 6s7a4lSlnro
_*49989 0:40 |going to try and form sort of a letter k. you point this finger up , your index finger| 6s7a4lSlnro
_*49990 0:45 |up . the middle finger you sort of stick down and the thumb touches that finger , so k. i 'll| 6s7a4lSlnro
_*49991 0:54 |show you what it looks like from this angle . k. that one may be a bit of a tricky one .| 6s7a4lSlnro
_*49992 1:03 |you 'll want to practice that . l. l is quite simple . l. it of course forms the letter l .| 6s7a4lSlnro
_*49993 1:14 |l. if we go from i , j , k , l. let 's put that together now as we go along . of course , with| 6s7a4lSlnro
_*49994 1:29 |any sort of sign language practice is what you 're going to need to do . the more you do| 6s7a4lSlnro
_*49995 1:33 |it the better that you 'll get at it . let 's go from a now to l. a , b , c , d , e , f , g , h ,| 6s7a4lSlnro

_*50000 0:15 |i . now for g , you just need one index finger to point straight out , g. g. looks like this| 6ztADHnpqdQ
_*50001 0:26 |from this side . g. h , you just want to add one more finger . h. i , tuck that in and stick| 6ztADHnpqdQ
_*50002 0:43 |out your pinky finger . i. g , h , and i . let 's review that one more time . g , h , and i . if| 6ztADHnpqdQ

_*50052 0:00 |hello ! my name is melissa and on behalf of expert village , today we 're going to be learning| 5Maz5muwqQ8
_*50053 0:04 |some basic signs , words , phrases in sign language . in this clip , we 're learn the words later ,| 5Maz5muwqQ8
_*50054 0:12 |stop , clock , yesterday , and sorry . let 's first start off with later . you want to take the| 5Maz5muwqQ8
_*50055 0:21 |letter l and your other hand and signify will be later . you take the l and you point it| 5Maz5muwqQ8
_*50056 0:34 |towards that person . later . later . later . later . stop , very easy . stop . stop . stop .| 5Maz5muwqQ8
_*50057 0:41 |clock . with this hand , with your left hand , form the letter c and then use your index| 5Maz5muwqQ8
_*50058 0:55 |finger and go in a circle clockwise . clock . clock . maybe you want to stop the clock . stop| 5Maz5muwqQ8
_*50059 1:04 |the clock . yesterday . take the letter y and take the thumb starting at your chin and work| 5Maz5muwqQ8
_*50060 1:10 |up towards your ear . yesterday . it 's the y signifying it passing . not later . yesterday .| 5Maz5muwqQ8
_*50061 1:18 |yesterday . yesterday . sorry . you want to take your hand in the letter a almost again . in| 5Maz5muwqQ8

_*50064 0:00 |hello , my name is melissa and on behalf of expert village , today we are going to be learning| TJbNoMUFJBA
_*50065 0:04 |some basic signs ; words and phrases in sign language . now , what i 've done in each of the| TJbNoMUFJBA
_*50066 0:10 |clips is picked about 5 or 6 different words . it 's very important when you first start learning| TJbNoMUFJBA
_*50067 0:15 |sign language ; one , to know your alphabet , a lot of phrases or words come from the alphabet| TJbNoMUFJBA
_*50068 0:21 |so it 's important to know your abcs . we have that in previous clips available on expert| TJbNoMUFJBA
_*50069 0:28 |village . so , know your abcs and know your letters and numbers , your numbers , your 1-2-3s .| TJbNoMUFJBA
_*50070 0:34 |so , i thought i 'd start off with some opposites here . it 's also important to keep in mind| TJbNoMUFJBA
_*50071 0:38 |when you are learning sign language to learn between maybe 5-10 words a day . anything more| TJbNoMUFJBA
_*50072 0:44 |than that will be difficult to retain . five is a good number . if you really want to push| TJbNoMUFJBA
_*50073 0:49 |yourself though , you are going to have to push yourself every day before we get into| TJbNoMUFJBA
_*50074 0:54 |phrases or you will begin to forget . think back to when you were a kid when you were| TJbNoMUFJBA
_*50075 0:58 |first learning how to spell and how to write . you could only learn a couple of words a day .| TJbNoMUFJBA
_*50076 1:04 |so let 's start off with some opposites here . we have 'above ' and 'below ' . so if we take| TJbNoMUFJBA
_*50077 1:09 |our hand 'above ' . so you want to take your right hand , if you are right-handed and you| TJbNoMUFJBA
_*50078 1:17 |basically circle the hand to show that something is above . same as , then again , 'below ' . you| TJbNoMUFJBA
_*50079 1:25 |can either circle your hand underneath here or you can take your hand and single 'below '| TJbNoMUFJBA
_*50080 1:33 |like there is something beneath an object here . so 'above ' and 'below ' or 'below ' . again ,| TJbNoMUFJBA
_*50081 1:42 |'on ' and 'off ' now , keep your hand out here and we 'll take this hand and we 'll put it| TJbNoMUFJBA
_*50082 1:46 |on , 'on ' . 'off ' i 'm sure you can figure out , 'off ' , the opposite , 'off ' . let 's try in and| TJbNoMUFJBA
_*50083 1:57 |out then . 'in ' you want to cup your hand into a circle here and you 're going to take these| TJbNoMUFJBA
_*50084 2:03 |four fingers and put them in , 'in ' . and 'out ' of course is the opposite of 'in ' . so you| TJbNoMUFJBA
_*50085 2:12 |are going to take those four fingers and take them out , 'out ' . so if we review these six| TJbNoMUFJBA
_*50086 2:18 |opposites , basically ; 'above ' , 'below ' , 'on ' , 'off ' , 'in ' and 'out ' .| TJbNoMUFJBA

_*50179 0:14 |the letters m , n , and o . so m , what you want to do is you want to form sort of the letter| IFtBJ_aQqp0

_*50300 0:16 |colors is that there 's a general spot that you sign for colors either here or just below| -VRaqX01Ekg
_*50301 0:24 |around the chin area . let 's start off with yellow . a lot of the colors all derive from| -VRaqX01Ekg
_*50302 0:30 |the alphabet . fundamentally , the most important thing you can learn in sign language is the| -VRaqX01Ekg
_*50303 0:35 |alphabet and at least the numbers form 1-10 . let 's form the letter y. y for yellow . again ,| -VRaqX01Ekg
_*50304 0:42 |the general space right in here really for signing colors . all you do is you shake it| -VRaqX01Ekg
_*50305 0:49 |just slightly . yellow . yellow . yellow . we move into orange , a little bit different .| -VRaqX01Ekg
_*50306 0:59 |as i said , over here yellow , or orange underneath the chin almost like you 're squeezing an orange .| -VRaqX01Ekg
_*50307 1:06 |orange . just beneath the chin . orange . orange . then we move to blue . back to the space over| -VRaqX01Ekg
_*50308 1:17 |here , form the letter b and just shake your hand slightly . blue . blue . blue . back to red .| -VRaqX01Ekg
_*50309 1:29 |remember orange . orange . well red is in the same area , but we 're pointing to the lips| -VRaqX01Ekg
_*50310 1:34 |and downward . red . red . to signify the redness of our lips . red . red . so we have orange and| -VRaqX01Ekg
